   The European Commission sent a warning letter Friday to Google and its
   subsidiary YouTube over disinformation and graphic content linked to
   the Hamas-Israel conflict, in the European Union’s latest effort to
   scrutinize Big Tech’s handling of the war.

   Breton highlighted legal requirements for Google to keep graphic
   content such as hostage videos away from underage users; to act swiftly
   when authorities flag content that violates European laws; and to
   mitigate disinformation.

   “This brings me to a second area of pressing concern: tackling
   disinformation in the context of elections, a priority which we
   personally discussed when we met in Brussels in May,” Breton wrote,
   referencing upcoming elections in a number of EU countries.
