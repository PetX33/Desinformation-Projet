   As Slovakia heads toward an election on Saturday, the country has been
   inundated with disinformation and other harmful content on social media
   sites. What is different now is a new European Union law that could

   The law, years of painstaking bureaucracy in the making, reflects a
   growing alarm in European capitals that the unfettered flow of
   disinformation online — much of it fueled by Russia and other foreign
   adversaries — threatens to erode the democratic governance at the core
   of the European Union’s values.

   Europe’s effort sharply contrasts with the fight against disinformation
   in the United States, which has become mired in political and legal
   debates over what steps, if any, the government may take in shaping
   what the platforms allow on their sites.
