Russian President Valdimir Putin signs law expanding restriction on LGBT
'propaganda'

Russia's new law bans spreading information about gender transitioning to
minors
--
   significantly expands restrictions on activities seen as promoting LGBT
   rights in the country.

   A 2013 law banned what authorities deem to be spreading "propaganda of
   non-traditional sexual relations" to minors. The new law expands that
   ban to spreading such information to people aged 18 and older.

   The new law outlaws advertising, media and online resources, books,
   films and theater productions deemed to contain such "propaganda."

   It also broadens the existing restrictions by banning information about
   gender transitions to be spread to minors and bans information deemed
   to be propaganda promoting pedophilia.

   Violations are punishable by fines and, if committed by non-residents,
   could lead to their expulsion from Russia.
