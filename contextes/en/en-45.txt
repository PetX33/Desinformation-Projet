   but they've taken us down several times."

   Meanwhile, the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has
   been criticized for a surge in disinformation spread on it, according
   to the news website Wired.

   Wired identified video game footage passed off as Hamas attacks, a
--
   taken this weekend, and images of fireworks in Algeria being shared as
   Israeli strikes on Hamas.

   Experts have said they believe the disinformation is a result of
   changes that X owner Elon Musk has made to the platform, including
   firing trust and safety staffers and an algorithm that promotes users
   who pay $8 per month for a premium subscription.

   Musk had directed followers to two sites that analysts say are known
   for sharing disinformation. The X owner later deleted those posts and
   tweeted to users that they should "try to stay as close to the truth as
   possible."
