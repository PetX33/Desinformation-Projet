Misinformation and Disinformation—What They Mean for the Israel-Hamas War

Bad information of any kind, intentional or accidental, leads to a “polluted
information environment” that can make it hard to tell what’s real and what’s

   Science.

   “One of the dangers here is that disinformation doesn’t just get you to
   believe a false thing is true; it also gets you to believe a true thing
   is false. That’s the poison that disinformation puts in the
   atmosphere,” McIntyre says.

   There’s an important distinction between the words disinformation and
   misinformation, he says: disinformation is an intentional falsehood,
   whereas misinformation is an accident.

   “Misinformation is when someone shares a falsehood, believing it to be
   true. Maybe they’ve been duped by someone else, but it’s information
   they think is true that they pass along,” he says. “Disinformation, on
   the other hand, is an intentional falsehood that someone created and
   shared in hopes of deceiving other people, for a purpose.”

   Both can be—and often are—at play during especially fraught global
   events, such as a presidential election or an emerging war. But,
   McIntyre says, disinformation in particular leaves insidious damage in
   its wake: “One thing that disinformation does is it erodes not only
   your knowledge base, but your trust in other people to tell you the
   truth, because sometimes disinformation comes in a neat little package
   of a conspiracy theory.”

   advantage of this confusing and convoluted influx of information to
   move public opinion.

   “I personally think the most dangerous part of disinformation is the
   way it can make us cynical, because it plays right into the
   authoritarians’ hands. Authoritarians love to use disinformation—maybe
   they can convince you [to believe their narrative], but even if they
   can’t convince you, they can demoralize you and make you feel like
   there’s no use even fighting back,” he says.

   Writing in Time magazine, BU’s Joan Donovan, a renowned expert in
   online misinformation and disinformation campaigns, says that the
   torrent of “true horror, violent pronunciations, sadness, and
   disinformation” online when talking about Hamas and Israel on social
   media is more than the “fog of war.” A College of Communication
   assistant professor, Donovan writes that “we are involved in an
   information war playing out across all social media platforms every
   day,” often as unwitting participants who share what may be dubious
   posts.

   Disinformation is everywhere, and thanks to artificial
   intelligence–powered tools, it’s easier to make than ever, McIntyre
   says, but he urges people not to lose hope. His new book, On
   Disinformation: How to Fight for Truth and Protect Democracy (MIT
   Press, 2023), outlines straightforward ways people can sift through
   information to determine what’s real.

   “This is a depressing topic, and I get that,” he says. “But it is also
   something that we can learn to fight back against. And the primary way
   to fight back is to expose [something as] disinformation. As I often
   say, ‘You cannot win a disinformation war unless you realize you’re in
   one.’”

            generally always reject the claim that they are responsible so
            we are in no position to decide who is telling the truth and
            then comment on an article about misinformation and
            disinformation in such a way.
            Like I said though, I agree with your statements about
            mainstream media being corrupt and not to be trusted but I do
            hope we genuinely understand that and avoid the traps.
