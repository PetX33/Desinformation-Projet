   Russian intelligence is operating a systematic program to launder
   pro-Kremlin propaganda through private relationships between Russian
   operatives and unwitting US and western targets, according to newly
   declassified US intelligence.

   CNN has reached out to Grigoriev.

   The official stressed that the Western voices that eventually became
   mouthpieces for Russian propaganda were almost certainly unaware of the
   role they were playing.

   “At the end of the day, this unwitting target is disseminating Russian
   influence operation, Russian propaganda to their target public,” the US
   official said. “Ultimately, a lot of these are unwitting people — they
   remain unaware who is essentially seeding these narratives.”
