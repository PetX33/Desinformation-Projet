   Even the word “propaganda” seems to somehow scream totalitarian state,
   more suited to “1984” than a country where liberty and freedom are
   central to national identity. Yet, disturbingly, propaganda may
   actually flourish even better in the fertile soil of liberal democracy.

   Nothing in a democracy is outside the reach of propaganda, from media
   to politics to education. Its influence on citizens’ choices can’t be
   overstated — and is even harder to overcome.

   In his new book, “How Propaganda Works,” Jason Stanley, a Yale
   philosophy professor, explains it’s always been that way. Stanley
   tracks propaganda’s history across continents and through decades,
   illuminating its power to make people vote against their own best
   interests. And what he has found is the words being used may be as
   important as the politics behind them.

   IDEAS: What do we, as citizens, need to know about the structure of
   propaganda?

   STANLEY: Propaganda is one of those issues that,
   whether you live in a democratic or totalitarian society, it’s always
   important. A problem comes from this linguistic strategy of making
   certain words say one thing but communicate another message. Some words
   have been taken and exploited for propaganda. There are innocent words
   that are politically dangerous.

   STANLEY: If I say, “That damn table is in my way,” all I’m saying is
   that the table is in my way. But what I’m conveying, what I’m telling
   you, is that I don’t like the table. I have a negative attitude toward
   it. Propaganda can politicize apparently nonpolitical words and give
   them what we call not-at-issue content. You can then model that content
   as an emotion, such as antipathy towards a group of people. . . .
   There’s no mystery left about how this happens. In fact, if it didn’t

   IDEAS: Are the uses of propaganda in a democracy rooted in this same
   exploitation of words?

   IDEAS: We hear a lot of talk about the impact of money in politics. Are
   big corporate donors and rhetoric about the private sector something
   new in the discussion of propaganda or old forces reincarnated?

   STANLEY: The opposite of democracy is the managerial state. This is
   where you have a planned society, with someone running the society

   being run more efficiently, we have to ask: Who is it more efficient
   for when services are cut?

   IDEAS: How can propaganda inform and educate people to defend their own
   interests in a more conscious way?

   STANLEY: All liberation movements have the need for propaganda. Because
   what happens? In a democratic society, policy is supposed to be decided
   by taking everyone’s perspective into account. Propaganda makes some
   people’s perspectives entirely invisible. You have to somehow shock
   people into recognition that there’s a perspective they haven’t been
   taking into account. And that’s what the civil rights movement was
