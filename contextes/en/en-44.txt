   Blue-checked users with an active subscription to X Premium continue to
   use the social media platform to spread disinformation about the
   Israel-Hamas conflict.

   Their tactics include recycling old footage and misattributing it
--
   desecrating a church in Gaza.

   Kanthan2030, a verified X user with 110,100 followers who regularly
   spreads pro-Russia disinformation, quoted another post with the same
   footage, falsely claiming it showed an attack by Syrian rebels:

   “Ignorance in US/EU is shocking. Terrorists in the video below were the
--
   deceptive manner with false context.

   These attempts by premium X subscribers to pass off old footage as
   Israel-Hamas war footage fit into a broader disinformation pattern.

   A recent study by NewsGuard, an information analysis company, found
   that blue-checked, “verified” X users had accounted for 74 percent of
--
   almost 70 percent of the time.”

   Subscribers to X Premium have a financial incentive to spread posts
   that go viral, including disinformation. That’s because blue-checked
   users are eligible for ad revenue sharing if they have 500 followers
   and have generated five million impressions in the preceding three
   months.

   Separately, a European Commission report found that the engagement of
   pro-Kremlin accounts spreading disinformation on X, particularly about
   Ukraine, had grown by 36 percent “after CEO Elon Musk decided to lift
   mitigation measures on Kremlin-backed accounts.”

   In September, European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova called X
   “the platform with the largest ratio of mis- or disinformation posts.”
