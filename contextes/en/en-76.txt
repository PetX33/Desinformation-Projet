   Iran on Tuesday charged two female journalists with "propaganda against
   the state" over their coverage of mass protests.

   The judiciary announced that the journalists — Niloufar Hamedi and
   Elaheh Mohammadi — are "remanded in custody for propaganda against the
   system and conspiring against national security."

   Both women have been in custody already for more than a month.
