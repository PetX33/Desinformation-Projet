A potent white supremacist tool — propaganda

New England saw a 96 percent increase in the distribution of hate speech
materials in 2022. Massachusetts led the way.

   What Wilson saw as “so terribly true” was a Ku Klux Klan hagiography
   that demonized Black men as sexually rapacious threats to white women
   and glorified white terrorism as the epitome of American patriotism.
   The sinister reach of the film’s virulent propaganda helped revive the
   Klan and ushered in another deadly wave of anti-Black violence.

   More than a century later, racist propaganda remains a potent tool in
   promoting white supremacy. According to the Anti-Defamation League,
   there were 6,751 recorded incidents of white supremacist propaganda
   activity last year, a 38 percent increase nationwide and an all-time
   high. And except for Texas, no state saw a more dramatic surge than
   Massachusetts.

   These are just a few of the 465 incidents that occurred in
   Massachusetts in 2022, a 72 percent increase from the previous year.
   That’s only part of the story. Including Massachusetts, there was a 96

   campuses a favored target for white supremacist literature.

   crossing the threshold of someone’s home in that way is very troubling
   to me.”

   How white supremacist propaganda proliferates changes. For decades,
   lynching postcards that depicted the murders of Black people weren’t
   just gruesome keepsakes and souvenirs. They also served as calling
   cards promoting white supremacist violence.

   What’s unchanged is propaganda as a hate accelerant. Now it can spread
   in the darkest corners of the Web, on social media, in movies available
   on Amazon, or on right-wing TV networks. When he was president, Donald
   Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric inspired mass shooters at a Pittsburgh

   Republicans continue to normalize the vilification of certain groups,
   especially trans people. Hate speech in state legislatures gets
   legitimized and replicated in propaganda. It’s not a big leap from
   anti-trans bills passed under the guise of “protecting children” to
   graffiti and fliers falsely branding drag performers as “groomers” and
   “pedophiles” intent on harming kids.
