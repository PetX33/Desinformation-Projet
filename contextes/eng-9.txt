   compromise for mutually beneficial solutions. Human selfishness,
   paranoia, in-group solidarity, and shortsightedness make suboptimal
   outcomes more likely. Look at Israel and Gaza: Amid massacres, forced
   deportations, a hostage crisis, disinformation, and arguably the worst
   outbreak of online ethnic hatred since the invention of the internet,
   it would seem nearly impossible to undertake the compromises needed to
   free Israeli hostages, prevent a humanitarian tragedy for Palestinian
--
   Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco, appear willing to see Hamas eradicated on
   the battlefield but are restricted in facilitating that outcome by the
   pro-Palestinian sentiments and massive Iranian and Russian
   disinformation campaigns among their populaces. What they are not
   restricted from doing is helping to implement a post-war interim
   solution for Gaza that safeguards Palestinian interests while
   preventing Hamasâ€™s resurgence.
