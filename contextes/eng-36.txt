   It’s been designed to combat misinformation and disinformation on
   digital platforms, but the [118]Combatting Misinformation and
   Disinformation bill exposure draft has unleashed a flurry of
   controversy, and its fair share of misinformation.

   So what are the facts around this legislation and will it end freedom

   The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said: “Acma will be
   given new information-gathering and record-keeping powers to create
   transparency around efforts by digital platforms to respond to
   misinformation and disinformation on their services, while balancing
   the right to freedom of expression so fundamental to democracy.”

   Under the proposal, Acma would be given the powers to register an
   enforceable industry code if the platform’s self-regulation measures
   “prove insufficient in addressing the threat posed by misinformation
   and disinformation”.

   address disinformation and “mal-information”.

   A voluntary code of conduct was drawn up by some of the major platforms
   in response and adopted by [120]Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter,

   Those concerns are largely centred around what they say are the broad
   definitions of disinformation and misinformation in the bill.

   Content could be considered misinformation if it’s “false, misleading
   or deceptive” and the provision of the content “is reasonably likely to
   cause or contribute to serious harm”. Disinformation includes a similar

   We don’t know what the final definitions of “misinformation” or
   “disinformation” will be.

   The University of Technology Sydney submitted to the inquiry that it
   believed some of the concerns to be “overblown” [137]but accepted there

   It proposed “limiting Acma’s information gathering powers to ‘measures
   implemented to prevent or respond’ to mis- and disinformation … thereby

   The Coalition’s 2022 [139]election platform included a promise to

   legislation seeking to do that an “absolute disgrace”.
