   Since becoming Twitter’s official owner on 27 October 2022,
   self-proclaimed free-speech defender Elon Musk has transformed the
   social media now called X into a sanctuary for disinformation.
   Reporters Without Borders (RSF) now regards X as the embodiment of the

     Head of RSF’s Tech Desk

   Twitter’s transformation has been political as well as technical. Under
   Musk’s leadership, Twitter ceased to be a signatory to the European
   Union's code of good practice against disinformation, now the code of
   conduct of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The social media company
   also carried out mass layoffs, especially within the “[253]Trust and
   Safety” teams responsible for protecting platform users, including
   moderation. These decisions have necessarily strengthened
   disinformation’s competitive advantage over content that is in the
   public interest.
