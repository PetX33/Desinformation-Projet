   officially designated election infrastructure as falling within CISA’s
   purview. The agency has since been key in garnering insight and
   offering guidance to private and public entities on how to stop the
   spread of misinformation and disinformation online.

   The issue of online disinformation came to a head during the 2016
   presidential election, and it remains a problem in the lead-up to the
   2024 elections. Of course, many Republicans these days rely on

   the now-defunct Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Misinformation
   & Disinformation subcommittee, which the Department of Homeland

   Governance Board. With that as context, Starbird’s words read as though
   she’s simply concerned about the public perception of the advisory
   board’s work — perhaps even concerned that its intentions would be
