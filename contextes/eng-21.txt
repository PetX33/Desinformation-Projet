   falling [72]within CISA’s purview. The agency has since been key in
   garnering insight and offering guidance to private and public entities
   on how to stop the spread of misinformation and disinformation online.

   The issue of online disinformation [73]came to a head during the 2016

   conspiracy theorists were spreading lies about the disinformation work
   within the DHS — [85]including [86]the[87] creation of a now-defunct
   Disinformation Governance Board. With that as context, Starbird’s words
   read as though she’s simply concerned about the public perception of
