   Even the word “propaganda” seems to somehow scream totalitarian state,
   more suited to “1984” than a country where liberty and freedom are
   central to national identity. Yet, disturbingly, propaganda may
   actually flourish even better in the fertile soil of liberal democracy.

   Nothing in a democracy is outside the reach of propaganda, from media
   to politics to education. Its influence on citizens’ choices can’t be
   overstated — and is even harder to overcome.

   In his new book, “How Propaganda Works,” Jason Stanley, a Yale
   philosophy professor, explains it’s always been that way. Stanley
   tracks propaganda’s history across continents and through decades,
   illuminating its power to make people vote against their own best
   interests. And what he has found is the words being used may be as

   them what we call not-at-issue content. You can then model that content
   as an emotion, such as antipathy towards a group of people. . . .

   IDEAS: Are the uses of propaganda in a democracy rooted in this same
   exploitation of words?

   IDEAS: We hear a lot of talk about the impact of money in politics. Are
   big corporate donors and rhetoric about the private sector something
   new in the discussion of propaganda or old forces reincarnated?

   IDEAS: How can propaganda inform and educate people to defend their own
   interests in a more conscious way?

   STANLEY: All liberation movements have the need for propaganda. Because
   what happens? In a democratic society, policy is supposed to be decided
   by taking everyone’s perspective into account. Propaganda makes some
   people’s perspectives entirely invisible. You have to somehow shock
   people into recognition that there’s a perspective they haven’t been
