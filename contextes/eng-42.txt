‘A deranged ploy’: how Republicans are fueling the disinformation wars

   Several actions by the far right in the last month could result in a
   flood of conspiracy theories before the 2024 election

   silence conservative voices. It is also the latest in a wider rightwing
   campaign to weaken attempts at stopping false information and
   conspiracy theories from proliferating online, one that has included
   framing disinformation researchers and their efforts as part of a
   wide-reaching censorship regime.

   Republican attorneys general in Missouri and Louisiana have sued Biden
   administration officials, the GOP-controlled House judiciary committee
   has demanded extensive documents from researchers studying
   disinformation, and rightwing media has attacked academics and
   officials who monitor social media platforms. Many of the researchers
   involved have faced significant harassment, leading to fears of a
   chilling effect on speaking out against disinformation ahead of the
   2024 presidential election.

   The Republican pushback against anti-disinformation campaigns has
   existed for years, alleging that content moderation on major platforms
   has unfairly targeted conservative voices. Many tech platforms have
   instituted policies against misinformation or hateful speech that have

   The rightwing narrative of tech platform censorship persisted, however,
   intensifying as companies prohibited medical misinformation about
   Covid-19. It gained additional momentum last year after the Department
   of Homeland Security rolled out [113]a disinformation governance board
   aimed at researching ways to stop malicious online influence campaigns
   and harmful misinformation. Republican politicians and rightwing media
   immediately seized on the board as proof of a leftist authoritarian

   followed, leading to Jankowicz receiving death threats, having
   information released online against her will.

   The disinformation governance board suspended its operations only a
   month after its debut, in what Jankowicz [116]told the Guardian earlier
   this week was the start of a larger rightwing campaign aimed at rolling
   back checks on disinformation. “They got a win in shutting us down, so
   why would they stop there?” said Jankowicz, who was originally named in
   the Louisiana lawsuit but removed on account of no longer being a
   government official.

   the federal government”. The House judiciary committee chair, Jim
   Jordan, earlier this year [117]issued a wide-ranging request for
   information and documents to multiple universities with programs aimed
   at researching disinformation, and has so far sent dozens of subpoenas.

   Among the institutions and officials that Jordan requested emails and
   documents from were the Stanford Internet Observatory, the University

   majority of Americans view it as a partisan attempt to score political
   points. But it has nonetheless put pressure on academic institutions
   and emboldened attacks against researchers, including the University of
   Washington disinformation expert Kate Starbird, who [124]told the
   Washington Post that she has faced political intimidation and cut back
   on public engagement.

   Starbird and other researchers are directly named in the Louisiana
   lawsuit for their role as advisers to a now-disbanded Cybersecurity and
   Infrastructure Security Agency subcommittee on disinformation.
   Starbird, who did not return a request for comment, has [125]previously
   stated that the Republican-led lawsuit egregiously misrepresents her
   work.

   administration this week, the Associated Press reported, [128]saying
   that the wide scope of the ruling meant that public health officials
   could be prevented from sharing their expertise. Meanwhile,
   disinformation researchers have stated that Republican efforts to push
   back against content moderation and safeguards against misinformation
   threaten to open the floodgates for conspiracy theories and falsehoods
   ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

   Amid the rightwing campaign against content moderation and
   disinformation researchers, numerous social media platforms have also
   been peeling back restrictions. Twitter under Elon Musk, who[129] last
   year engineered the release of some internal communications between
   Twitter and government officials, [130]has hollowed out its content
