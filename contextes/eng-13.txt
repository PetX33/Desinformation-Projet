   The war comes after Elon Musk, the owner of X, laid off much of the
   team responsible for monitoring posts on the site. On Tuesday, the
   European Union sent the billionaire a letter asking him to immediately

   imposed," the E.U. warned.

   X said early last week that they have already removed "Hamas-affiliated
   accounts" and "several hundred accounts." Other major social media
   platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, and Snap told CBS News that they

   deceptive, we're throwing away the goodwill of our citizens," Caulfield
