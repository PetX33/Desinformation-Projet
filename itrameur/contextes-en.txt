Disinformation and Hate Speech on Social Media Contribute to Inciting War
Crimes Against Gaza

   emotions. As the fog of war and polarization make it difficult to
   verify information and find credible or reliable sources, social media
   platforms become vital information spaces. But those platforms also
   become part of the information warfare where disinformation and fake
   content are rampant, hate speech and incitement spread, and extreme and
   graphic content gets amplified by the algorithms of social media
   platforms and garner the most engagement and attention. Social media
   users share unverified, misleading, or miscaptioned content, spread
   doctored images and altered documents, and amplify baseless claims. In
   the coverage of the recent Hamas attack on Israel and the latter’s
   criminal bombardment of Gaza, the amount of disinformation, false
   content, and violent hate speech on social media platforms has reached
   unprecedented levels. This type of content incites further violence,
   manufactures support for war crimes, and impacts real world policy
--
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and social media content is fanning the
   flames of further violence.

Unprecedented Scale and Speed of Disinformation

   There is a flood of misinformation and falsehoods circulating on social
   media, claiming to show the recent events in Israel and Palestine,
   including mischaracterized content, misleading captions, false images,
   out-of-context and old videos, and video game footage. The level of
   disinformation, especially on X (formerly Twitter), has never been seen
   before and is spreading at accelerated speed due to its graphic and
   emotional nature, which in turn widens its reach. According to some
   analysts, 20 percent of the accounts participating in these

   especially after waves of layoffs at many tech companies like X and
   Meta, which impacted content and safety teams.

   While disinformation spreads on all social media sites, X is the most
   impactful as it has been the primary platform for political content,
   where users go first to find information on breaking news and
   developing events. However, after being acquired by Elon Musk, X has
   become the platform with the largest amount of disinformation and hate
   speech. Musk, who reposts far-right antisemitic accounts and verifiably
   false content, has eliminated teams that deal with disinformation and
   human rights and safety at the company, and instituted platform changes
   that made it easier for false information to spread. For example, the
   introduction of the $8 per month premium subscription in exchange for
--
   external links, reportedly for aesthetic reasons, could be further
   exacerbating the problem as articles are only represented by images
   without context. Musk’s efforts since taking over Twitter (now X) have
   essentially removed any existing guardrails on disinformation and hate
   speech, made it more difficult for researchers to study content and
   patterns on the platform, and made this information environment more
   susceptible to exploitation by malicious actors.

Hate Speech and the Silencing of Palestinian Narratives

   In addition to disinformation, hateful and violent content and cyber
   harassment have been rampant on social media platforms. Some

Misinformation and Disinformation—What They Mean for the Israel-Hamas War

Bad information of any kind, intentional or accidental, leads to a “polluted
information environment” that can make it hard to tell what’s real and what’s

   fellow at Boston University’s Center for Philosophy &amp; History of
   Science.

   “One of the dangers here is that disinformation doesn’t just get you to
   believe a false thing is true; it also gets you to believe a true thing
   is false. That’s the poison that disinformation puts in the
   atmosphere,” McIntyre says.

   There’s an important distinction between the words disinformation and
   misinformation, he says: disinformation is an intentional falsehood,
   whereas misinformation is an accident.

   “Misinformation is when someone shares a falsehood, believing it to be
   true. Maybe they’ve been duped by someone else, but it’s information
   they think is true that they pass along,” he says. “Disinformation, on
   the other hand, is an intentional falsehood that someone created and
   shared in hopes of deceiving other people, for a purpose.”

   Both can be—and often are—at play during especially fraught global
   events, such as a presidential election or an emerging war. But,
   McIntyre says, disinformation in particular leaves insidious damage in
   its wake: “One thing that disinformation does is it erodes not only
   your knowledge base, but your trust in other people to tell you the
   truth, because sometimes disinformation comes in a neat little package
   of a conspiracy theory.”

   In this polluted information environment, truth and falsehoods exist

   advantage of this confusing and convoluted influx of information to
   move public opinion.

   “I personally think the most dangerous part of disinformation is the
   way it can make us cynical, because it plays right into the
   authoritarians’ hands. Authoritarians love to use disinformation—maybe
   they can convince you [to believe their narrative], but even if they
   can’t convince you, they can demoralize you and make you feel like
   there’s no use even fighting back,” he says.

   Writing in Time magazine, BU’s Joan Donovan, a renowned expert in
   online misinformation and disinformation campaigns, says that the
   torrent of “true horror, violent pronunciations, sadness, and
   disinformation” online when talking about Hamas and Israel on social
   media is more than the “fog of war.” A College of Communication
   assistant professor, Donovan writes that “we are involved in an
   information war playing out across all social media platforms every
   day,” often as unwitting participants who share what may be dubious
   posts.

   Disinformation is everywhere, and thanks to artificial
   intelligence–powered tools, it’s easier to make than ever, McIntyre
   says, but he urges people not to lose hope. His new book, On
   Disinformation: How to Fight for Truth and Protect Democracy (MIT
   Press, 2023), outlines straightforward ways people can sift through
   information to determine what’s real.

--

   “This is a depressing topic, and I get that,” he says. “But it is also
   something that we can learn to fight back against. And the primary way
   to fight back is to expose [something as] disinformation. As I often
   say, ‘You cannot win a disinformation war unless you realize you’re in
   one.’”

   The Chinese government likely was behind a "spamouflage" disinformation
   campaign targeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader
   Pierre Poilievre and other MPs in August and September, says Global
   Affairs Canada.

   The department's Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), which was set up to
   monitor foreign state-sponsored disinformation efforts, said the
   campaign was "connected to the People's Republic of China" and was
   meant to curb criticism of the communist regime.

   According to a report released Monday morning, the propaganda campaign
   began in August and targeted dozens of MPs from across the political
   spectrum.

   A "spamouflage" campaign is one which uses a network of new or hijacked
   social media accounts to post propaganda messages across
   various platforms, such as Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, YouTube,
   Medium, Reddit, TikTok and LinkedIn.

   release millions of tons of treated radioactive water from the wrecked
   Fukushima nuclear power plant.

   In August, the Rapid Response Mechanism reported that a disinformation
   operation on the Chinese social media platform WeChat had spread false
   information about Conservative MP Michael Chong. That campaign
   spread false narratives about his identity, including commentary and
   claims about his background, political stances and family heritage.

China investing "unprecedented resources" in disinformation, surveillance

   China's government is investing "unprecedented resources" in a range of

   the reader that the most effective campaign is the one that is won by
   indirect methods to break the enemy’s will to fight before the battle
   begins. In many ways, this principle remains the main objective of
   covert actions, propaganda and information operations.

   In February 2021, Twitter published a report documenting 373 accounts
   believed to be part of a coordinated effort by Iran, Armenia and Russia
--
   each other’s positions. This struggle can be traced back to the Cold
   War.

   Covert propaganda during the Cold War

   During the Cold War, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union relied on
   propaganda as an information operations tool to undermine and degrade
   their adversaries’ will to fight. By the 1970s, BBC broadcasts to the
   East bloc were listened to by almost 50% of the Soviet population,
   despite Soviet efforts to jam these transmissions. It is also true that
   the West effectively used propaganda to disseminate information on the
   benefits of capitalism. For example, Western films were used to
   propagate capitalism’s and democracy’s benefits, and to demonize
   communism. In the 1950s, the CIA bought the movie rights to George
   Orwell’s book “Animal Farm” to use as a propaganda tool in the East
   bloc. Western efforts to undermine communist governments in the East
   proved detrimental to Soviet performance during the Cold War.

   supporting separatist and nationalist movements by financing
   information operations, and the intensive use of dezinformatsiya, or
   disinformation, campaigns that included blaming the spread of HIV on
   the CIA. During the Cold War, a large part of information operations
   was also oriented toward influencing local populations in the Soviet
   Union and satellite countries. The main objectives of this strategy
--
   documents as models to fabricate false war plans designed to build
   tension between countries. Agents of influence were another tool for
   conducting information operations. These agents recruited sympathizers,
   who weren’t aware that they were being used to spread disinformation.
   The World Peace Council’s campaign, including demonstrations against
   enhanced radiation weapons in the U.S., was an example of the Soviet
   use of agents of influence. Finally, the Soviet Union relied on
--
   fake news through conventional media outlets. While these campaigns
   were directed at domestic news outlets, Soviet agents also targeted the
   foreign press, inserting falsely attributed material. For instance, the
   TASS news agency oversaw the global spread of Soviet propaganda. It had
   a substantial overseas representation with more than 400 staff and
   correspondents in 126 countries. Many of them were connected to Soviet
   state security organs, including foreign intelligence.

   Additionally, it has proved to the world how social media plays a vital
   role in propagating cleverly tailored messages and how traditional
   media can be used to spread disinformation or misinformation. Russia
   has shown that information operations can have more tangible results

   spread of misinformation and disinformation online.

   The issue of online disinformation came to a head during the 2016
   presidential election, and it remains a problem in the lead-up to the
   2024 elections. Of course, many Republicans these days rely on

   However, the committee’s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, isn’t letting
   the facts drown out some useful propaganda. He and his conservative

   ProPublica reported in March that Jordan had begun issuing “sweeping

   On June 6, The Washington Post reported on Kate Starbird, the
   co-founder of an anti-disinformation think tank at the University of
   Washington who has faced online harassment over her work. Some of the
   documents Jordan obtained relating to Starbird appear to form the basis
   of the committee report’s dubious “censorship” claims.

   For example, the report notes that Starbird formerly served as chair of
   the now-defunct Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Misinformation
   &amp; Disinformation subcommittee, which the Department of Homeland
   Security established for disinformation experts to provide insight to
   CISA. The report cites communications from Starbird in which she
   expressed concern about public attention.

   And reading the report, one might conclude Starbird thought the
   advisory board had something to hide. But at the time, right-wing
   conspiracy theorists were spreading lies about the disinformation work
   within the DHS — including the creation of a now-defunct Disinformation
   Governance Board. With that as context, Starbird’s words read as though

2020 election disinformation targeted voters of color and 2024 will be worse,
groups say

   Community organizations are preparing for what they expect to be a
   worsening onslaught of disinformation targeting communities of color
   and immigrant communities.

   communities of color.

   As the 2024 election approaches, community organizations are preparing
   for what they expect to be a worsening onslaught of disinformation
   targeting communities of color and immigrant communities. They say the
   tailored campaigns challenge assumptions of what kinds of voters are
   susceptible to election conspiracies and distrust in voting systems.
--
   A growing subset of communities of color, especially immigrants for
   whom English is not their first language, are questioning the integrity
   of U.S. voting processes and subscribing to Trump’s lies of a stolen
   2020 election, said Jenny Liu, mis/disinformation policy manager at the
   nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice. Still, she said these
   communities are largely left out of conversations about misinformation.

   think of someone who’s older, maybe from a rural area, maybe a white
   man,” she said. “You don’t think of Chinese Americans scrolling through
   WeChat. That’s why this narrative glosses over and erases a lot of the
   disinformation harms that many communities of colors face.”

Tailoring disinformation

   In addition to general misinformation themes about voting machines and
   mail-in voting, groups are catering their messaging to communities of
--
   Venezuela or who have lived through the Chinese Cultural Revolution may
   be “more vulnerable to misinformation claiming politicians are wanting
   to turn the U.S. into a Socialist state,” said Inga Trauthig, head of
   research for the Propaganda Research Lab at the Center for Media
   Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin. People from countries
   that have not recently had free and fair elections may have a
   preexisting distrust of elections and authority that may make them
   vulnerable to misinformation as well, Trauthig said.

   Disinformation efforts often hinge on topics most important to each
   community, whether that is public safety, immigration, abortion,
   education, inflation or alleged extramarital affairs, said Laura
   Zommer, co-founder of the Spanish-language fact-checking group

   spaces” found on messaging apps or groups on social media sites like
   Facebook, Trauthig said.

   “But disinformation also targets them on these platforms, even though
   it may feel to them to be that safer space,” she said.

   Messages on WhatsApp are also encrypted and can’t be easily seen or

   “As a result, messages on apps like WhatsApp often fly under the radar
   and are allowed to spread and spread, largely unchecked,” said Randy
   Abreu, policy counsel for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, which
   leads the Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition.

   Abreu also raised concerns about Spanish YouTube channels and radio
   shows that are growing in popularity. He said the coalition is tracking
--
   elections. Many of these videos remained on the platform, despite
   violating YouTube election misinformation policy, the report said.

Disinformation — and disenfranchisement

   Amid changes in voting policies at state and local levels, advocates
   are sounding the alarm on how disinformation about voting in 2024 may
   target communities of color. Many of these efforts have surged as Asian
   American, Black and Latino communities have grown in political power,
   said María Teresa Kumar, founding president of the nonprofit advocacy
   group Voto Latino.

   “Disinformation is, at its core, meant to be a sort of voter
   suppression tactic for communities of color,” she said. “It targets
   communities of color in a way that feeds into their already justifiable
   concerns that the system is stacked against them.”
--

   While many of the same recycled claims around alleged fraud in the 2020
   and 2022 elections are expected to resurface, experts say
   disinformation campaigns will likely be more sophisticated and granular
   in attempts to target specific groups of voters of color.

   Trauthig also raised concerns about how layoffs and instability at
--
   communities of color to help approach trends in misinformation
   narratives, experts said.

   “These are not monolithic groups,” Cruz said. “This disinformation is
   very specifically tailored to each of these communities and their
   fears. So we also need to be partnering with grassroots organizations

   operations” over the weekend, one tied to Russia and another with
   connections to Belarus, the companies said.

   One of the operations, a propaganda campaign featuring a website
   pushing anti-Ukraine talking points, was an offshoot of a known Russian
   disinformation operation. A Facebook spokesperson said it used
   computer-generated faces to bolster the credibility of fake columnists
   across several platforms, including Instagram.

   The other campaign used hacked accounts to push similar anti-Ukraine
   propaganda and was tied to a known Belarusian hacking group.

   Disinformation experts warned that Russia is expected to continue to
   try to manipulate narratives about Ukraine — most notably around the
   claims made by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

   The announcement also demonstrates that Russia continues to use
   disinformation strategies first identified years ago around the 2016
   election, albeit with some advancements — most notably the use of
   software that can create realistic and original human faces.

   The larger of the two disinformation groups operated in Russia, as well
   as the Russian-dominated Donbas and Crimea regions of Ukraine, said
   Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta's head of security policy, and it is tied to
   the websites News Front and South Front, which the U.S. government has
   designated as part of a broader disinformation effort that had
   connections to Russian intelligence. (Meta is the parent company of
   Facebook.)

   Gleicher said in an interview that the propaganda campaign was able to
   “seed stories across the internet that Ukraine isn’t doing well” by
   “pretending to be journalists based in Kyiv.”

   connections to the accounts that were previously banned. Both websites
   have pushed misleading articles, questioning the results of the 2020

   a 2020 report.

   The websites featured articles pushing Russian talking points like

   Facebook said it took down 40 profiles tied to the disinformation

   Telegram and Russian social networks.

   Twitter said it banned more than a dozen accounts tied to the News

   them to spread pro-Russian propaganda.

   The hackers targeted journalists, military personnel and local public

   War in Ukraine

Russian disinformation, propaganda ramp up as conflict in Ukraine grows

   Disinformation experts say they have already seen a concerted effort to
   push a false narrative around the reasons for invading Ukraine — and
   that more is on the way.

   Feb. 24, 2022, 4:36 PM UTC / Updated Feb. 26, 2022, 3:06 PM UTC
   By Jason Abbruzzese

   Russia’s effort to spread disinformation and propaganda across the
   internet and through foreign and domestic media about its invasion of
   Ukraine started weeks ago — and it’s expected to ramp up now that the
   conflict has begun.

   Disinformation experts say that they have seen a concerted effort from
   Russian leaders and state-backed media to push a false narrative around
   the reasons for invading Ukraine, and that they expect that to continue
   as both international pressure and even some domestic Russian
--
   Politics and Public Policy. “And we need to be prepared for that.”

   Lytvynenko said people should be prepared for a wide variety of
   disinformation and propaganda, including the use of authentic images
   and video to push false narratives.

   “We know that propaganda is a part of every war, and we know that after
   every attack we see a flood of propaganda,” she said. “This propaganda
   can take many forms. It can try to take videos out of context and claim
   for them to be something else. It can show Russian attacks as more
   powerful than they actually were.
--

   Videos and images have already begun to pour out of Ukraine, many
   showing destroyed military vehicles and explosions. And during a
   conflict, disinformation and propaganda can also be a tool used by all
   sides. Some media that is circulating has been found to be recycled
   from other conflicts, including one post from a verified Ukrainian
   military Facebook page that posted what purported to be Ukrainian
--
   often the location can change from one city to another or the date gets
   mixed up or the description misinterprets what’s going on."

   Disinformation often conjures memories of the 2016 U.S. presidential
   election, when Russian bots pushed misleading and politically divisive
   claims on social media. But that will not necessarily be the playbook
   for the conflict with Ukraine, according to Ben Strickland, director of
   investigations at the Centre for Information Resilience, a nonprofit
   organization based in London that actively monitors disinformation
   campaigns.

   Strickland said he’s seen a shift in recent days away from Russian
   propaganda that sought to blame Western democracies and NATO for
   causing tensions and toward justifying an invasion of Ukraine. That has
   included disinformation and false accusations about fascists and
   neo-Nazis in Ukraine.

   “From about Feb. 14 onward we started to see the use of the term
--

   IFRAME: //iframe.nbcnews.com/HVz4d8n?_showcaption=true&amp;app=1

   Strickland said that most of the disinformation his organization has
   tracked has not been pushed by the kinds of bot-driven social media
   operations that many think of in relation to Russian propaganda
   campaigns, but has instead been mostly focused on disseminating
   information on so-called false flag attacks (fake events meant to
   manipulate narratives) that have then been amplified by Russian media.
--
   and mass casualties and then seeing that used as ‘Ukrainians are the
   terrorists,’” he said.

   Stickland noted that these kinds of disinformation efforts are
   primarily meant to shore up support for military conflict within
   Russia, pointing specifically to the state-backed media outlet RT.

Disinformation Researchers Raise Alarms About A.I. Chatbots

   Researchers used ChatGPT to produce clean, convincing text that
   repeated conspiracy theories and misleading narratives.
--
   online misinformation and conducted the experiment last month.
   “Crafting a new false narrative can now be done at dramatic scale, and
   much more frequently — it’s like having A.I. agents contributing to
   disinformation.”

   Disinformation is difficult to wrangle when it’s created manually by
   humans. Researchers predict that generative technology could make
   disinformation cheaper and easier to produce for an even larger number
   of conspiracy theorists and spreaders of disinformation.

   Personalized, real-time chatbots could share conspiracy theories in
   increasingly credible and persuasive ways, researchers say, smoothing
--
   language.

   ChatGPT is far more powerful and sophisticated. Supplied with questions
   loaded with disinformation, it can produce convincing, clean variations
   on the content en masse within seconds, without disclosing its sources.
   On Tuesday, Microsoft and OpenAI introduced a new Bing search engine
   and web browser that can use chatbot technology to plan vacations,
   translate texts or conduct research.

Disinformation From ChatGPT

   When researchers at NewsGuard asked ChatGPT to write responses based on
   false and misleading ideas, the bot complied about 80 percent of the

   OpenAI researchers have long been nervous about chatbots falling into
   nefarious hands, writing in a 2019 paper of their “concern that its
   capabilities could lower costs of disinformation campaigns” and aid in
   the malicious pursuit “of monetary gain, a particular political agenda,
   and/or a desire to create chaos or confusion.”

   reference solutions to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind.”

   Researchers also worry that the technology could be exploited by
   foreign agents hoping to spread disinformation in English. Some
   companies already use multilingual chatbots to support customers
   without translators.

--
   Working last month off a sampling of 100 false narratives from before
   2022 (ChatGPT is trained mostly on data through 2021), NewsGuard asked
   the chatbot to write content advancing harmful health claims about
   vaccines, mimicking propaganda and disinformation from China and Russia
   and echoing the tone of partisan news outlets.

   The technology produced responses that seemed authoritative but were

Finding Its Voice

   ChatGPT was able to embody the language and voice of disinformation
   peddlers, using popular phrases like “do your own research.” In this
   example, researchers at NewsGuard asked for vaccine misinformation in
   the voice of Joseph Mercola, an anti-vaccine doctor. Pfizer updated its

   When The New York Times repeated the experiment using a sample of
   NewsGuard’s questions, ChatGPT was more likely to push back on the
   prompts than when researchers originally ran the test, offering
   disinformation in response to only 33 percent of the questions.
   NewsGuard said that ChatGPT was constantly changing as developers
   tweaked the algorithm and that the bot might respond differently if a
   user repeatedly inputs misinformation.

   Much of the conversation around journalism and democracy concerns the

   I think these are important questions. But to the extent that the

   As Slovakia heads toward an election on Saturday, the country has been

   The law, years of painstaking bureaucracy in the making, reflects a
   growing alarm in European capitals that the unfettered flow of
   disinformation online — much of it fueled by Russia and other foreign
   adversaries — threatens to erode the democratic governance at the core
   of the European Union’s values.

   A federal judge’s decision this week to restrict the government’s
   communication with social media platforms could have broad side
   effects, according to researchers and groups that combat hate speech,
   online abuse and disinformation: It could further hamper efforts to
   curb harmful content.

   Alice E. Marwick, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at
   Chapel Hill, was one of several disinformation experts who said on
   Wednesday that the ruling could impede work meant to keep false claims
   about vaccines and voter fraud from spreading.

   The order, she said, followed other efforts, largely from Republicans,
   that are “part of an organized campaign pushing back on the idea of

Disinformation is setting us on a dark path. We need laws to protect us from

   every single day.

   But alongside the memes, social media platforms are allowing
   disinformation to spread like wildfire, with frightening repercussions.
   Big tech companies make decisions about what content to amplify, and
   thus have a huge degree of power over public discourse. With that power
   comes a responsibility to prevent the spread of misinformation and
   disinformation. Right now, they’re failing abysmally.

   In Australia, as we’re seeing across the globe, disinformation is being
   used as a powerful weapon by far-right groups to gain public support
   for regressive movements that want to wind back human rights.

   Most recently, disinformation was used in the referendum to sow
   confusion and undermine support for the voice to parliament. During the
   campaign, racism and fearmongering was rife on social media platforms,
   and amplified on television, radio and newspapers by traditional media.

   Disinformation targets people’s fears and anxieties to recruit them to
   extremist ideologies, and polarises our communities for political or
   financial gain. Once unleashed, it travels seamlessly across social
   media, between newspapers, talkback radio and messaging apps.

   Disinformation is extremely lucrative for digital platforms like Meta
   and X (formerly Twitter) and their multibillionaire owners.
   Disinformation captures our attention and guarantees our engagement
   online, which can be monetised to advertisers. The spread of
   disinformation isn’t accidental – it’s incentivised by the tech giants’
   business models. And yet we have no laws to stop this – or even uncover
   it.

   In Europe, lawmakers have responded by introducing the Digital Services
   Act, which requires large social media companies to undertake annual
   risk assessments, including the foreseeable impact on people’s human

   reasonable, proportionate and effective mitigation measures for any

   For the past few months, the Albanese government has been consulting
   widely on an exposure draft of a bill to take its first step towards
   curbing misinformation and disinformation on social media.

   The combating misinformation and disinformation bill would empower the
   Australian Communications and Media Authority to oversee the degree to
   which social media companies comply with their own codes of conduct
   and, where they fail, enforce them. The government’s first draft needs
   work – there are issues with what’s regarded as disinformation, for
   one. But the government has committed to addressing many of the
   concerns raised, and the proposal as a whole is hardly radical – it
   gives great deference to social media platforms and doesn’t go nearly

   Predictably, the proposal has sparked outrage from the Liberal party –
   confected, because it was originally their idea – and the likes of News
   Corp, the Australian Christian Lobby and Advance Australia. The draft
   bill, ironically, has been the subject of disinformation: Advance
   Australia (which faced a number of controversies for spreading
   disinformation in the 2022 election and voice referendum) have
   described it as creating a “Ministry of Truth” seeking to control
   Australians.

   Instead, they’re asking for it to be “ripped up”.

   We need parliament to step in and pass laws that will protect our right
   to freedom of speech, while also shining a light on how disinformation
   is spread, and by whom. We then need social media companies to change
   the way they do business, so they’re no longer biased toward promoting
   hate speech and disinformation. We need users to have much more control
   over how their data is used and the ability to opt out of being

   It’s been designed to combat misinformation and disinformation on

   bill exposure draft has unleashed a flurry of controversy, and its fair

   The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said: “Acma will be
   given new information-gathering and record-keeping powers to create
   transparency around efforts by digital platforms to respond to
   misinformation and disinformation on their services, while balancing
   the right to freedom of expression so fundamental to democracy.”

   Under the proposal, Acma would be given the powers to register an
   enforceable industry code if the platform’s self-regulation measures
   “prove insufficient in addressing the threat posed by misinformation
   and disinformation”.

   Importantly, the bill does not give Acma any “take down” powers. It

   A voluntary code of conduct was drawn up by some of the major platforms
   in response and adopted by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter,
   TikTok, Redbubble, Apple and Adobe in 2021. Acma was given the job of
   keeping an eye on how the platforms upheld the code. That same year,
   the watchdog reported to the Morrison government its concerns over the

   Those concerns are largely centred around what they say are the broad
   definitions of disinformation and misinformation in the bill.

   Content could be considered misinformation if it’s “false, misleading
   or deceptive” and the provision of the content “is reasonably likely to
   cause or contribute to serious harm”. Disinformation includes a similar
   definition but with the added clause of addressing whether the person

   The University of Technology Sydney submitted to the inquiry that it
   believed some of the concerns to be “overblown” but accepted there was
   legitimate concern about the enlarged role for Acma.

   It proposed “limiting Acma’s information gathering powers to ‘measures
   implemented to prevent or respond’ to mis- and disinformation … thereby

US warns of Chinese disinformation. China says that’s disinformation

   A US State Department report that accuses the Chinese government of
   expanding disinformation efforts is “in itself disinformation,”
   Beijing’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed Saturday.

   The ministry shot back after the State Department issued a striking
   report this week in which it accused the Chinese government of

   and disinformation that promotes “digital authoritarianism” in China
   and around the world.

   Referring to wars in Iraq and Syria as well as US reports alleging
   human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang as examples, the ministry
   claimed that the US is “an ‘empire of lies’ through and through.”

   “No matter how the US tries to pin the label of ‘disinformation’ on

EU warns Elon Musk after Twitter found to have highest rate of disinformation

   The EU has issued a warning to Elon Musk to comply with sweeping new
   laws on fake news and Russian propaganda, after X – formerly known as
   Twitter – was found to have the highest ratio of disinformation posts
   of all large social media platforms.

   The report analysed the ratio of disinformation for a new report laying
   bare for the first time the scale of fake news on social media across
   the EU, with millions of fake accounts removed by TikTok and LinkedIn.

--

   “Mr Musk knows he is not off the hook by leaving the code of practice,”
   said the European commissioner Věra Jourová, who is responsible for the
   implementation of the new anti-disinformation code.

   “There are obligations under the hard law. So my message for Twitter/X
   is you have to comply. We will be watching what you do.”

   “X, formerly Twitter … is the platform with the largest ratio of
   mis/disinformation followed by Facebook,” she told reporters.

   The 200-page report is an account of the work the large platforms have
   done in the first six months of 2023 to prepare for compliance with the
   new law and lifts the lid on the behind-the-scenes efforts made by
   Facebook and others to crack down on Russian propaganda, hate speech
   and other disinformation.

   in relation to 800,000 search queries about the war in Ukraine.

   manipulation aimed both internally at the Russians as well as Europeans
   and the rest of the world. And we must address this. The very large

   The war in Ukraine was the most frequent topic for propaganda but the
   platforms also reported hate speech in relation to migration, LBGTQ+
   communities and the climate crisis.

   “I think it is one of the advantages of disinformation, is that they
   are so predictable,” said Jourová, making it easier for factcheckers to
   find.

   On Twitter, she said “disinformation actors were found to have

Disinformation reimagined: how AI could erode democracy in the 2024 US
elections

   Advances in generative artificial intelligence could supercharge the
   propaganda playbook, experts warn


   Nick Robins-Early

   Now, as the 2024 presidential election comes into view, experts warn
   that advances in AI have the potential to take the disinformation
   tactics of the past and breathe new life into them.

   AI-generated disinformation not only threatens to deceive audiences,
   but also erode an already embattled information ecosystem by flooding
   it with inaccuracies and deceptions, experts say.

--

   In some ways, these images and ads are not so different from the
   manipulated images and video, misleading messages and robocalls that
   have been a feature of society for years. But disinformation campaigns
   formerly faced a range of logistic hurdles – creating individualized
   messages for social media was incredibly time consuming, as was
   Photoshopping images and editing videos.
--
   accessible to anyone with even basic digital skills, amid limited
   guardrails or effective regulation to curtail it. The potential effect,
   experts warn, is a sort of democratization and acceleration of
   propaganda right at a time when several countries enter major election
   years.

AI lowers the bar for disinformation

   The potential harms of AI on elections can read like a greatest hits of
   concerns from past decades of election interference. Social media bots
--
   influence US elections or undermine their integrity, as federal
   officials have long warned Russia and China are working to do. Language
   barriers to creating deceptive content are eroding, and telltale signs
   of scammers or disinformation campaigns using repetitive phrasing or
   strange word choices are being replaced with more believable texts.

   “If you’re sitting in a troll farm in a foreign country, you no longer
--
   question what role artificial intelligence will play in the vote. The
   creation of misleading AI-generated content alone doesn’t mean that it
   will have an effect on an election, researchers say, and measuring the
   impact of disinformation campaigns is a notoriously difficult task.
   It’s one thing to monitor the engagement of fake materials but another
   to gauge the secondary effects of polluting the information ecosystem
   to the point where people generally distrust any information they
--

   But there are concerning signs. Just as the use of generative AI is
   increasing, many of the social media platforms that bad actors rely on
   to spread disinformation have begun rolling back some of their content
   moderation measures – YouTube reversed its election integrity policy,
   Instagram allowed the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy
   Jr back on its platform and Twitter’s head of content moderation left

   The methods and techniques described by Team Jorge raise new challenges
   for big tech platforms, which have for years struggled to prevent

   campaign to weaken attempts at stopping false information and
   conspiracy theories from proliferating online, one that has included
   framing disinformation researchers and their efforts as part of a
   wide-reaching censorship regime.

   Republican attorneys general in Missouri and Louisiana have sued Biden
   administration officials, the GOP-controlled House judiciary committee
   has demanded extensive documents from researchers studying
   disinformation, and rightwing media has attacked academics and
   officials who monitor social media platforms. Many of the researchers
   involved have faced significant harassment, leading to fears of a
   chilling effect on speaking out against disinformation ahead of the
   2024 presidential election.

   The Republican pushback against anti-disinformation campaigns has
   existed for years, alleging that content moderation on major platforms
   has unfairly targeted conservative voices. Many tech platforms have
   instituted policies against misinformation or hateful speech that have

   The rightwing narrative of tech platform censorship persisted, however,
   intensifying as companies prohibited medical misinformation about
   Covid-19. It gained additional momentum last year after the Department
   of Homeland Security rolled out a disinformation governance board aimed
   at researching ways to stop malicious online influence campaigns and
   harmful misinformation. Republican politicians and rightwing media

   checks on disinformation. “They got a win in shutting us down, so why

   researching disinformation, and has so far sent dozens of subpoenas.

   Americans view it as a partisan attempt to score political points. But
   it has nonetheless put pressure on academic institutions and emboldened
   attacks against researchers, including the University of Washington
   disinformation expert Kate Starbird, who told the Washington Post that
   she has faced political intimidation and cut back on public engagement.

   Starbird and other researchers are directly named in the Louisiana
   lawsuit for their role as advisers to a now-disbanded Cybersecurity and
   Infrastructure Security Agency subcommittee on disinformation.
   Starbird, who did not return a request for comment, has previously
   stated that the Republican-led lawsuit egregiously misrepresents her

   Legal experts questioned Doughty’s injunction against the Biden
   administration this week, the Associated Press reported, saying that
   the wide scope of the ruling meant that public health officials could

   content moderation and safeguards against misinformation threaten to
   open the floodgates for conspiracy theories and falsehoods ahead of the
   2024 presidential election.

   Amid the rightwing campaign against content moderation and

   Subscribers to X Premium have a financial incentive to spread posts
   that go viral, including disinformation. That’s because blue-checked
   users are eligible for ad revenue sharing if they have 500 followers
   and have generated five million impressions in the preceding three
   months.

   Separately, a European Commission report found that the engagement of
   pro-Kremlin accounts spreading disinformation on X, particularly about
   Ukraine, had grown by 36 percent “after CEO Elon Musk decided to lift
   mitigation measures on Kremlin-backed accounts.”

   In September, European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova called X
   “the platform with the largest ratio of mis- or disinformation posts.”

finds

   A report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found that the
--

   A small network of pro-Kremlin content creators have seen their
   audiences grow dramatically in recent months while spreading
   disinformation about the war in Ukraine, evading social media
   platforms’ efforts to curb Russian propaganda and paving a path to
   Western audiences, according to research published Wednesday.

   The creators are self-described “independent journalists” whose reports
--
   atrocities. Researchers say the on-the-ground reports — which come in
   English, French, German and other languages — have proved effective at
   circumnavigating commitments from European governments and U.S.-based
   social media platforms to stop the spread of Russian propaganda.

   Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, many tech platforms took
   steps to curb the amplification of false Russian narratives.
--
   them globally. Facebook and YouTube have banned Russian
   state-controlled media outlets from advertising. Twitter, Facebook and
   YouTube apply labels and links to fact checks on content that violates
   their policies against disinformation about the war.

   Most of these efforts focused on official Russian government and state
   media accounts. That plan, while partially effective, misses a major
   vector of Kremlin disinformation, according to the Institute for
   Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that produced the
   research.

--
   affiliations, and embassies and consulates,” said Melanie Smith, ISD’s
   director of digital analysis. “It misses a large volume of content
   coming from actors who can reach huge audiences very quickly and spread
   pro-Kremlin disinformation without the state actually having to be
   directly involved.”

   Content creators and social media influencers have emerged in the past
   year as one of the newer avenues for disinformation. Some YouTubers
   exposed a plot to use creators to spread Covid disinformation, while
   The Associated Press reported in March that China’s government had
   found success with its own network of English-language creators.

--
   “considerably higher.”

   Smith said the creators have proven particularly difficult to moderate
   and a powerful tool for spreading propaganda.

   “Some of the disinformation that we see spread quickly isn’t being
   fact-checked because they’re reaching an audience that is deemed to be
   smaller or less important than that reached by RT and Sputnik, but the
   talking points are the same and the evidence being presented is the
   same,” Smith said. “These are independent people who can speak freely
   within the bounds of the policies of the platforms. And sometimes, that
   spills over into incitement of violence, denying war crimes and
   spreading very blatant pieces of disinformation about the context of
   what’s happening and about how people are being victimized.”

From Twitter to X, Elon Musk’s transformation from free speech defender to
champion of disinformation

   AFP
   Organisation:
--

   Since becoming Twitter’s official owner on 27 October 2022,
   self-proclaimed free-speech defender Elon Musk has transformed the
   social media now called X into a sanctuary for disinformation.
   Reporters Without Borders (RSF) now regards X as the embodiment of the
   threat that online platforms pose to democracies.

   In the course of a year in which he has humiliated public media and
   censored journalists, the businessman ranked by Forbes as the world’s
   richest person has shattered what was one of the few social media
   bulwarks against disinformation and has instead become one of the
   strongest allies of disinformation producers.

   The most dangerous decisions for access to reliable information have
   included transforming account certification. From a security system

   Israel-Hamas war, claims that have been viewed 100 million times.

     “Elon Musk has completed his transformation from free speech
     defender to champion of disinformation. Most of his decisions have
     had the effect of strengthening disinformation producers and
     weakening access to reliable news and information on his platform.
     What with the insults that he personally aims at the professional
     news media and the new anti-information direction that X is taking
     under his leadership, journalists and news media are no longer
     welcome there. Twitter was already an unsafe network for
     information, but X has become disinformation’s stronghold.”

     Vincent Berthier
     Head of RSF’s Tech Desk

   Twitter’s transformation has been political as well as technical. Under
   Musk’s leadership, Twitter ceased to be a signatory to the European
   Union's code of good practice against disinformation, now the code of
   conduct of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The social media company
   also carried out mass layoffs, especially within the “Trust and Safety”
   teams responsible for protecting platform users, including moderation.
   These decisions have necessarily strengthened disinformation’s
   competitive advantage over content that is in the public interest.

   In RSF’s view, X embodies the fundamental problem posed by large

   China is now one of the last places on earth trying to eliminate

   Propaganda has long been one of the Chinese Communist Party’s favored
   tools for social control. But in the Covid era, the government’s use of
   it has been on overdrive. By some estimates, at least 120 Covid-related
   propaganda phrases have been created since the beginning of the

   broadcasting a notice for P.C.R. testing. He said the announcements had
   disturbed his sleep at night and woke him up at dawn.

   “Our life was dictated and disciplined by propaganda and state power,”
   he said.

   To communicate his frustrations, Mr. Yang selected 600 common Chinese
   propaganda phrases, such as “core awareness,” “obey the overall
   situation” and “the supremacy of nationhood.” He gave each phrase a
   number and then put the numbers into Google’s Random Generator, a

   When Mr. Yang uploaded a video of the scene online, however, more than

Russia Intensifies Its Propaganda Campaign Against Ukraine

   A new push by the Kremlin frames the war as a counterterrorism
   operation and seeks to rally Russians to support the fight, officials
--
   By Julian E. Barnes
   Oct. 26, 2022

   WASHINGTON — Since before the war, Russia has spread disinformation
   about its need to stamp out Nazism in Ukraine. But in recent days,
   Moscow’s propaganda has shifted, arguing that it is battling terrorism
   and falsely accusing Ukraine of planning a dirty bomb attack as part of
   that narrative.

   The new propaganda, spread on social media and in the news, also
   includes unsupported allegations that the Ukrainian government intends
   to destroy a dam in its own territory, according to European and
   American government officials and independent researchers.
--
   “They seem to have decided on a talking point that this is a
   counterterrorism operation now,” said Kyle Walter, who leads the U.S.
   investigation team at Logically, a tech start-up that helps governments
   and businesses counter disinformation. “Rather than framing this as

   A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known

Newly declassified US intel claims Russia is laundering propaganda through

   Social media have been one of the few available ways for Palestinians
   to tell their stories under the Israeli occupation and blockade. But
   censorship and account suspensions threaten that outlet. As the war on

   further. This is mixed with the rapid spread of disinformation and

   Led by the Kremlin's example, a global rise in disinformation and

   world, a new report finds.

   In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based

   Can Civil Society and Private Organizations Combat Russian Propaganda
   in Africa?

   (BUTTON) Print
   WASHINGTON —

   As Russia makes significant gains in its disinformation campaigns in
   Africa, experts say civil society groups and private organizations may
   hold the key to counter such propaganda.

   Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine two years ago, analysts say the
   Kremlin has been using disinformation spread through social media to
   court other nations as it faces global isolation.

   Dan Whitman, a foreign policy analyst and fellow at Philadelphia-based
   think tank Foreign Policy Research Institute, told VOA that Moscow has
   recently made “tremendous successes” in its disinformation campaigns on
   the continent, exploiting political instability in regions like the
   Sahel and Central Africa, and in nations like Mozambique.

   “I would say (in) two or three years, (Russia) has made the most rapid
   propaganda successes in the history of propaganda,” Whitman said,
   adding “instability is the Garden of Eden for disinformation.”

   Whitman says Russia doesn’t cause instability but takes advantage of
   existing instability, unlike other major powers. He said the difference
--

   Whitman also highlighted the worry of possible Russian interference in
   the 2024 U.S. elections, as in previous elections, emphasizing the need
   for a mechanism to hold the Kremlin accountable for its disinformation
   activities. He suggested empowering civil society groups and private
   organizations, with support from the U.S. government and Western
   European governments, to counter Russian disinformation.

   “I believe that small start-ups, private organizations and community
   groups like debunk.org in Lithuania, should be empowered to counter
   Russia’s disinformation. I hope they have open and transparent support
   from the U.S. government and governments of Western Europe,” Whitman
   told VOA.

   Neil Melvin, director of International Security Studies at the
   London-based Royal United Security Institute, or RUSI, says while
   Russia seeks to advance its propaganda narrative, describing its
   efforts as the “biggest propaganda victory ever,” may be an
   exaggeration — even as Russia takes an opportunistic approach in
   regions with instability, aiming to establish partnerships with
   military groups seeking power.

   Fighting Disinformation

   Melvin said disinformation is not solely a Russian effort, as China and
   Iran also engage in state-backed disinformation campaigns, which many
   countries struggle to effectively counter.

   “Civil society becomes almost a security asset because they challenge
   the disinformation that sometimes is coming down mainstream channels,”
   he told VOA’s English to Africa Service. “Maybe this is the moment for
   the African Union or some of the regional organizations to try and set
   up their own independent media monitoring organizations to make sure
   that the population can push back on Russian disinformation.”

   According to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, an academic and
   research program focused on security, in 2022, 60% of Africa’s more
   than 50 documented disinformation campaigns were externally
   coordinated.

   However, the center says, figures of externally driven disinformation
   campaigns in Africa may not be entirely accurate with the growing trend
   of using local influencers to disseminate content, making their origins
   harder to trace.

   China to “influence Africa’s conversation.”

   “In the past five months, what I have been seeing is a calculative
   spread of disinformation that seems to glorify Russia and the Wagner
   Group as if they’re the only way out to Africa’s problems,” Jonathan
   told VOA. He said he has observed social media users posting
   disinformation-and-misinformation to counter African democracy,
   emphasizing rhetoric for Africa to align with Russia.

   Jonathan said organizations and coalitions should be working to raise
   awareness of Russia’s disinformation efforts on social media.

   “What I have been doing is to assess social media awareness of Russia’s
   disinformation in Africa, and to find out whether Africans are even
   aware of such subtle influences.”

   GT investigates: Unveiling propaganda campaign by Philippines, Western
   media to defame China, stir up trouble in South China Sea
   By GT staff reporters Published: Nov 20, 2023 10:57 AM Updated: Nov 19,
   2023 09:24 PM

   dangerous harassment" are a few of the high-frequency keywords that
   have emerged in recent reports by major Philippine media outlets
   regarding China's justified actions in the South China Sea, an
   indication of an intensifying false propaganda offensive by the
   Philippines.
   The Philippine government has extensively laid the groundwork to aid in
   swaying public opinion, including creating conflicts in disputed waters
   through the use of various "props" and launching strong premeditated
   counterattacks.
   The most iconic bit of fake news material from the Philippine
   propaganda campaign in the South China Sea comes from their "grounded"
   vessel at Ren'ai Jiao. Ren'ai Jiao is part of China's Nansha Island.
   However, the Philippines has "grounded" a military vessel at Ren'ai
   Jiao and attempted to repair and reinforce it in an attempt to
--
   intercepted by the China Coast Guard (CCG). Surprisingly, they then
   approached the CCG patrol ship, resulting in two consecutive collisions
   between the two vessels.
   Following this incident, the Philippines began a series of propaganda
   attacks. The Philippine Presidential Communications Office publicly
   stated on Facebook that Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos
   had convened a special command conference of the national security and
--
   claims that the CCG were driving away Filipino fishermen, and recent
   demands to dismantle the floating barriers placed by China, the
   Philippine authorities and local media outlets have continuously
   escalated their propaganda, gradually forming a mature set of arguments
   by utilizing sporadic public opinion attacks, Peng Nian, a scholar at
   China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global
   Times.
--
   These recent disputes are actually part of a series of actions taken by
   the Philippines against China's stance on the South China Sea issue.
   These include providing supplies to grounded vessels, inviting foreign
   media outlets to report on the propaganda, and conducting joint patrols
   with the US, Dai Fan, director of the Center for Philippine Studies at
   Jinan University, told the Global Times.
   "The Philippine government aims to establish an image of China bullying
--
   strategic mutual trust with the ASEAN. At the same time, once fake news
   stirs up nationalist sentiments within the Philippines, it will also be
   of great detriment for the country.
   Such propaganda theatrics are likely to continue between the
   Philippines and some Western media, but we hope that the Philippines
   will reconsider its stance and exercise restraint, making a genuine
   choice to promote a peaceful resolution to the South China Sea issue,

   Use of Children in Propaganda
   (BUTTON) Subscribe to International Man

   International Man: Throughout history, governments have always used

   For example, during World War 1, the US media whipped up a frenzy by

   40 Israeli babies. President Joe Biden repeated the incident. It was
   later revealed not to have occurred.

   These are just a few examples of this propaganda tactic.

   What is your take on all of this?

   Doug Casey: It’s long been said, quite correctly, that “The first
   casualty in war is truth.” Especially when it comes to war reporting,
   you never know what to believe. It’s impossible to separate truth from
   propaganda most of the time. Emotion almost always triumphs over

   International Man: Even if the lies are later exposed, it’s often too

   Doug Casey: To quote another old aphorism, “A lie can get halfway
   around the world before truth even puts on its walking shoes.”

   With propaganda, it’s important to get your word out as soon as

A potent white supremacist tool — propaganda

New England saw a 96 percent increase in the distribution of hate speech
materials in 2022. Massachusetts led the way.
--
   What Wilson saw as “so terribly true” was a Ku Klux Klan hagiography
   that demonized Black men as sexually rapacious threats to white women
   and glorified white terrorism as the epitome of American patriotism.
   The sinister reach of the film’s virulent propaganda helped revive the
   Klan and ushered in another deadly wave of anti-Black violence.

   More than a century later, racist propaganda remains a potent tool in
   promoting white supremacy. According to the Anti-Defamation League,
   there were 6,751 recorded incidents of white supremacist propaganda
   activity last year, a 38 percent increase nationwide and an all-time
   high. And except for Texas, no state saw a more dramatic surge than
   Massachusetts.
--
   These are just a few of the 465 incidents that occurred in
   Massachusetts in 2022, a 72 percent increase from the previous year.
   That’s only part of the story. Including Massachusetts, there was a 96
   percent increase in recorded white supremacist propaganda activity
   across New England in 2022. Patriot Front and Nationalist Social Club,
   or NSC-131, are the most prevalent in this region and account for the
   majority of hateful propaganda.

   Peggy Shukur, ADL New England’s interim regional director, said these
   groups “have made a concerted effort to concentrate in New England,” in
--
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   Propaganda is also used for recruitment in an attempt “to lure people
   into the movement,” Shukur said. That’s made New England’s many college
   campuses a favored target for white supremacist literature.

--
   crossing the threshold of someone’s home in that way is very troubling
   to me.”

   How white supremacist propaganda proliferates changes. For decades,
   lynching postcards that depicted the murders of Black people weren’t
   just gruesome keepsakes and souvenirs. They also served as calling
   cards promoting white supremacist violence.

   What’s unchanged is propaganda as a hate accelerant. Now it can spread
   in the darkest corners of the Web, on social media, in movies available
   on Amazon, or on right-wing TV networks. When he was president, Donald
   Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric inspired mass shooters at a Pittsburgh
--

   Republicans continue to normalize the vilification of certain groups,
   especially trans people. Hate speech in state legislatures gets
   legitimized and replicated in propaganda. It’s not a big leap from
   anti-trans bills passed under the guise of “protecting children” to
   graffiti and fliers falsely branding drag performers as “groomers” and
   “pedophiles” intent on harming kids.

rife with atrocity

   I was astonished by Renée Graham’s column “In the battle between Israel
   and Hamas, another potent weapon — propaganda” (Opinion, Oct. 18),
   which cited propaganda as a major issue regarding the Oct. 7 massacre
   in Israel by Hamas terrorists. While there is no question that
   misinformation across the board is a significant area of concern,
   Graham’s parsing of what was or was not a confirmed atrocity was
   insensitive and cold.

   Why has she not cited the ongoing Hamas propaganda against Israel? For
   example, when the hospital was hit in Gaza, the media were quick to
   place the blame on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces promptly released
   intelligence that strongly indicated otherwise.
--

   At first I was encouraged when I saw the headline of Renée Graham’s
   Oct. 18 column: “In the battle between Israel and Hamas, another potent
   weapon — propaganda.” I had just read, from another news source, the
   story that the Israel Defense Forces had presented evidence that it was
   a misfired Gazan rocket that caused the Gaza hospital blast, and that
   Hamas was using this tragedy to foment further hatred against Israel.

   “It’s, to me, the definition of street art — it’s getting your message
   out there by any means necessary,” he said in a phone interview.

   Others see the fliers as a form of propaganda. “I think the posters are
   indicative, actually, of what’s going on in American media,” said
   Jhally, who’s the founder and executive director of the Media Education
   Foundation.

   Even the word “propaganda” seems to somehow scream totalitarian state,
   more suited to “1984” than a country where liberty and freedom are
   central to national identity. Yet, disturbingly, propaganda may
   actually flourish even better in the fertile soil of liberal democracy.

   Nothing in a democracy is outside the reach of propaganda, from media
   to politics to education. Its influence on citizens’ choices can’t be
   overstated — and is even harder to overcome.

   In his new book, “How Propaganda Works,” Jason Stanley, a Yale
   philosophy professor, explains it’s always been that way. Stanley
   tracks propaganda’s history across continents and through decades,
   illuminating its power to make people vote against their own best
   interests. And what he has found is the words being used may be as
   important as the politics behind them.

   IDEAS: What do we, as citizens, need to know about the structure of
   propaganda?

   STANLEY: Propaganda is one of those issues that,
   whether you live in a democratic or totalitarian society, it’s always
   important. A problem comes from this linguistic strategy of making
   certain words say one thing but communicate another message. Some words
   have been taken and exploited for propaganda. There are innocent words
   that are politically dangerous.

   STANLEY: If I say, “That damn table is in my way,” all I’m saying is
   that the table is in my way. But what I’m conveying, what I’m telling
   you, is that I don’t like the table. I have a negative attitude toward
   it. Propaganda can politicize apparently nonpolitical words and give
   them what we call not-at-issue content. You can then model that content
   as an emotion, such as antipathy towards a group of people. . . .
   There’s no mystery left about how this happens. In fact, if it didn’t

   IDEAS: Are the uses of propaganda in a democracy rooted in this same
   exploitation of words?

   STANLEY: This is actually Plato’s problem with democracy in Book VIII

   IDEAS: We hear a lot of talk about the impact of money in politics. Are
   big corporate donors and rhetoric about the private sector something
   new in the discussion of propaganda or old forces reincarnated?

   STANLEY: The opposite of democracy is the managerial state. This is
   where you have a planned society, with someone running the society
--
   being run more efficiently, we have to ask: Who is it more efficient
   for when services are cut?

   IDEAS: How can propaganda inform and educate people to defend their own
   interests in a more conscious way?

   STANLEY: All liberation movements have the need for propaganda. Because
   what happens? In a democratic society, policy is supposed to be decided
   by taking everyone’s perspective into account. Propaganda makes some
   people’s perspectives entirely invisible. You have to somehow shock
   people into recognition that there’s a perspective they haven’t been
   taking into account. And that’s what the civil rights movement was
