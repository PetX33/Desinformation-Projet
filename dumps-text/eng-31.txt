   They said a restriction on government interaction with social media
   companies could impede efforts to curb false claims about vaccines and
   voter fraud.

   A [14]federal judge’s decision this week to restrict the government’s
   communication with social media platforms could have broad side
   effects, according to researchers and groups that combat hate speech,
   online abuse and disinformation: It could further hamper efforts to
   curb harmful content.

   Alice E. Marwick, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at
   Chapel Hill, was one of several disinformation experts who said on
   Wednesday that the ruling could impede work meant to keep false claims
   about vaccines and voter fraud from spreading.

   The order, she said, followed other efforts, largely from Republicans,
   that are “part of an organized campaign pushing back on the idea of
   disinformation as a whole.”

   Judge Terry A. Doughty granted a preliminary injunction on Tuesday,
   saying the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation, along with other parts of the government, must
   stop corresponding with social media companies for “the purpose of
   urging, encouraging, pressuring or inducing in any manner the removal,
   deletion, suppression or reduction of content containing protected free
   speech.”
