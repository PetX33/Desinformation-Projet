‘A deranged ploy’: how Republicans are fueling the disinformation wars

   Several actions by the far right in the last month could result in a
   flood of conspiracy theories before the 2024 election


   Mon 10 Jul 2023 12.00 CESTLast modified on Mon 10 Jul 2023 17.55 CEST

   A federal judge in Louisiana [110]ruled last week that a wide range of
   Biden administration officials could not communicate with social media
   companies about content moderation issues, and in a lengthy opinion
   described the White House’s outreach to platforms as “almost dystopian”
   and reminiscent of “an Orwellian ministry of truth”.

   The ruling, which was delivered by the Trump-appointed judge Terry
   Doughty, was a significant milestone in a case that [111]Republicans
   have pushed as proof that the Biden administration is attempting to
   silence conservative voices. It is also the latest in a wider rightwing
   campaign to weaken attempts at stopping false information and
   conspiracy theories from proliferating online, one that has included
   framing disinformation researchers and their efforts as part of a
   wide-reaching censorship regime.

   Republican attorneys general in Missouri and Louisiana have sued Biden
   administration officials, the GOP-controlled House judiciary committee
   has demanded extensive documents from researchers studying
   disinformation, and rightwing media has attacked academics and
   officials who monitor social media platforms. Many of the researchers
   involved have faced significant harassment, leading to fears of a
   chilling effect on speaking out against disinformation ahead of the
   2024 presidential election.

   The Republican pushback against anti-disinformation campaigns has
   existed for years, alleging that content moderation on major platforms
   has unfairly targeted conservative voices. Many tech platforms have
   instituted policies against misinformation or hateful speech that have
   resulted in content such as election denial, anti-vaccine falsehoods
   and far-right conspiracy theories being removed – all which tend to
   skew Republican. But research has found that allegations of
   anti-conservative bias at social media companies have little empirical
   evidence, with a 2021 [112]New York University study showing that these
   platforms’ algorithms instead often work to amplify rightwing content.

   The rightwing narrative of tech platform censorship persisted, however,
   intensifying as companies prohibited medical misinformation about
   Covid-19. It gained additional momentum last year after the Department
   of Homeland Security rolled out [113]a disinformation governance board
   aimed at researching ways to stop malicious online influence campaigns
   and harmful misinformation. Republican politicians and rightwing media
   immediately seized on the board as proof of a leftist authoritarian
   plot.

   Fox News hosts specifically singled out researcher Nina Jankowicz, who
   was tapped to be the board’s executive director, and ran numerous
   segments viciously mocking her. A year-long [114]harassment campaign
   followed, leading to Jankowicz receiving death threats, having
   information released online against her will.

   The disinformation governance board suspended its operations only a
   month after its debut, in what Jankowicz [116]told the Guardian earlier
   this week was the start of a larger rightwing campaign aimed at rolling
   back checks on disinformation. “They got a win in shutting us down, so
   why would they stop there?” said Jankowicz, who was originally named in
   the Louisiana lawsuit but removed on account of no longer being a
   government official.

The GOP takes aim at researchers

   In addition to the lawsuit in Louisiana, Republicans have put pressure
   on researchers through a House select subcommittee investigation that
   launched in January and claims it will look into the “weaponization of
   the federal government”. The House judiciary committee chair, Jim
   Jordan, earlier this year [117]issued a wide-ranging request for
   information and documents to multiple universities with programs aimed
   at researching disinformation, and has so far sent dozens of subpoenas.

   Among the institutions and officials that Jordan requested emails and
   documents from were the Stanford Internet Observatory, the University
   of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public and the non-profit
   Election Integrity Partnership. Jordan last month threatened Stanford
   University with legal action if it did not turn over additional
   records. (Stanford released communications with government officials
   but did not send some internal records, including ones that involved
   students, [118]the university told the Washington Post.)

   The Stanford Internet Observatory, the Center for an Informed Public
   and the Election Integrity Partnership did not return requests for
   comment.

   Democratic representatives decried the committee’s activities as an
   attempt to harangue researchers and institutions that its members
   viewed as political enemies, likening it to McCarthyism and the House
   Committee on Un-American Activities.

     This committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by the Maga
     extremists who have hijacked the Republican party

   Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts

   “This committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by the Maga
   extremists who have hijacked the Republican party and now want to use
   taxpayer money to push their far-right conspiracy nonsense,” Jim
   McGovern, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts, said during
   the formation of the committee.

   after newsletter promotion

   The committee has struggled to be seen as legitimate, with a
   majority of Americans view it as a partisan attempt to score political
   points. But it has nonetheless put pressure on academic institutions
   and emboldened attacks against researchers, including the University of
   Washington disinformation expert Kate Starbird, who [124]told the
   Washington Post that she has faced political intimidation and cut back
   on public engagement.

   Starbird and other researchers are directly named in the Louisiana
   lawsuit for their role as advisers to a now-disbanded Cybersecurity and
   Infrastructure Security Agency subcommittee on disinformation.
   Starbird, who did not return a request for comment, has [125]previously
   stated that the Republican-led lawsuit egregiously misrepresents her
   work.

The Louisiana lawsuit

   Republicans filed the lawsuit against Biden last year, and were joined
   by other plaintiffs that included the conspiracy site the Gateway
   Pundit and a Louisiana group opposed to vaccine mandates.

   The case was notably filed in a Louisiana district court where Judge
   Terry Doughty presides. Doughty, who was appointed by Trump and
   mandates, is a jurist Republicans specifically seek out when shopping
   for a favorable forum. He has overseen more multi-state challenges to
   the Biden administration than any other judge, [127]Bloomberg Law
   reported, despite previously being a little-known justice based in a
   small city of less than 50,000 people.

   Legal experts questioned Doughty’s injunction against the Biden
   administration this week, the Associated Press reported, [128]saying
   that the wide scope of the ruling meant that public health officials
   could be prevented from sharing their expertise. Meanwhile,
   disinformation researchers have stated that Republican efforts to push
   back against content moderation and safeguards against misinformation
   threaten to open the floodgates for conspiracy theories and falsehoods
   ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

   Amid the rightwing campaign against content moderation and
   disinformation researchers, numerous social media platforms have also
   been peeling back restrictions. Twitter under Elon Musk, who[129] last
   year engineered the release of some internal communications between
   Twitter and government officials, [130]has hollowed out its content
   moderation teams. Meanwhile, YouTube has [131]reversed a policy banning
   election denialism and Instagram allowed the prominent anti-vaccine
   activist Robert F Kennedy Jr back on the platform.

   The Biden administration stated this week that it objected to Doughty’s
   injunction in the Louisiana case, and would be considering its options.
   The justice department [132]is seeking to appeal the ruling.
