institution,' leaders say

   Antisemitism and Islamophobia are running through college campuses

Antisemitism and Islamophobia are running through college campuses

   FOX News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the
   unrest in colleges over the Israeli-Hamas conflict on ’Special Report.’

   Presidents from nine universities in Israel signed and sent a letter to
   their international colleagues on Wednesday to express their "deep
   concern" over narratives from some academic institutions that
   "misrepresent" the conflict between Israel and Hamas, or even target
   Israelis and Jews.

   On Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and murdered more than 1,400
   people, including babies, children, Jews, Muslims and Christians, while
   also taking 240 people hostage.

   In retaliation, Israel launched an offensive targeting Hamas leaders
   hiding among the people of Gaza. Some see the retaliation from Israel
   as murderous, while others say Israelis have the right to defend
   themselves after falling victim to a surprise attack.

   The nine presidents — Prof. Arie Zaban, president of Bar-Ilan
   University; Prof. Daniel A. Chamovitz, president of Ben-Gurion
   University of the Negev; Prof. Alon Chen, president of Weizmann
   Institute of Science; Prof. Asher Cohen, president of the Hebrew
   University of Jerusalem; Prof. Leo Corry, president of the Open
   University of Israel; Prof. Ehud Grossman, president of Ariel
   University; Prof. Ariel Porat, president of Tel-Aviv University; Prof.
   Ron Robin, president of University of Haifa; Prof. Uri Sivan, president
   of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology — stood together by
   signing a letter in opposition of the infiltration of ideas suggesting
   Hamas’s atrocities were justified.

   "We find ourselves facing a war on two fronts: one against the
   atrocities of Hamas, and another in the global arena of public
   opinion," the university presidents said in the letter. "Regrettably,
   we have noticed an alarming trend in which Israel, despite its right to
   self-defense, is mischaracterized as an oppressor. This is a false
   equivalence between the actions of a murderous terrorist organization
   and a sovereign state's right to defend its citizens, which
   unfortunately results in the loss of innocent Palestinian lives."

   The presidents who signed the letter say the anti-Israel and
   antisemitic sentiments are largely fueled by a "naive and biased
   understanding of the conflict."

   The presidents noted that higher learning institutions should be known
   for being centers for intellectual and progressive thoughts,
   enlightenment and rational discourse.

   Now, the letter reads, campuses have adopted Hamas as the cause of
   celebration, while demonizing Israel.

   "There is no moral equivalency here. Let’s be clear: Hamas shares no
   values with any Western academic institution," the letter reads. "Hamas
   is an organization that has repeatedly pledged to annihilate Israel and
   its people."

   The letter goes on to say Hamas uses international aid to arm itself
   instead of providing aid of its people, and also uses citizens as
   shields, hiding in hospitals, schools and mosques.

   The presidents called for their colleagues to illuminate their lights
   and "stand as lighthouses in the intellectual landscape."

   "Your roles as leaders of these institutions confer upon you an
   extraordinary responsibility: to guide the moral and ethical
   development of your students, to imbue them with the ability to think
   critically and to discern the nuances that separate right from wrong,"
   the letter reads. "Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of academic
   freedom, but it should not be manipulated to legitimize hate speech or
   to justify violence.

   "We urge you to delineate the boundaries between constructive discourse
   and destructive propaganda, and promote evidence-based, nuanced
   thinking that challenges simplistic narratives," the presidents added.

   They also reminded the learning institutions that Israeli and Jewish
   students and faculty at higher learning facilities be given the same
   respect and protections as all minorities, ensuring inclusivity and
   campus safety are extended to those members of the community.

   The presidents said the events of Oct. 7 should be a wake-up call to
   the dangers of "nihilistic organizations" like ISIS and Hamas that
   represent the opposite of liberty and freedom.

   "As leaders of Israeli universities, we have been heartened by clear
   statements of solidary and support for Israel, which are, at their
   heart, statements in solidary with humanity, enlightenment, and
   progress," the presidents said, before concluding their message. "At
   the same time, we are calling for a sea change in clarity and truth in
   academia on the matter of Israel’s war against Hamas, so that light
   will triumph over dark, now and always."
