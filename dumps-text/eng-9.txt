Qatar is the key to peace in postwar Gaza

American and British diplomats should be working on creating a pan-Arab
coalition to administer postwar Gaza — and Qatar’s role would be particularly
important.

   Even in the best of times, diplomats struggle to get adversaries to
   compromise for mutually beneficial solutions. Human selfishness,
   paranoia, in-group solidarity, and shortsightedness make suboptimal
   outcomes more likely. Look at Israel and Gaza: Amid massacres, forced
   deportations, a hostage crisis, disinformation, and arguably the worst
   outbreak of online ethnic hatred since the invention of the internet,
   it would seem nearly impossible to undertake the compromises needed to
   free Israeli hostages, prevent a humanitarian tragedy for Palestinian
   civilians, and forge an optimal solution for postwar governance in
   Gaza.

   Yet, we mustn’t lose hope. [134]Plans are being negotiated by
   entrepreneurs and experienced go-betweens tying comprehensive hostage
   release to postwar humanitarian assistance for Gaza. They can, however,
   be brought to fruition only if they include[135] postwar interim
   governance arrangements that empower Arab allies to take responsibility
   for Gaza and to facilitate an end to hostilities.

   American and British diplomats should be working on creating a Qatari,
   Emirati, Saudi, and Egyptian coalition — known in this context as a
   borders, health care, infrastructure, and education for five to 10
   years while rebuilding, rooting out Hamas, and preparations for
   elections are undertaken in parallel. Lessons from post-conflict states
   that have held elections too early — for example, Libya and Egypt after
   the Arab Spring — should serve as a warning against a rush to turn
   things over to the Palestinian Authority or to bring about elections
   too soon.

   This urgent diplomacy does not have to touch the intractable issues
   concerning the final status of the West Bank, the Israeli settlements
   there, or even the final status of Gaza.

   things fall apart

   Unlike in previous Arab-Israeli Wars, the main Arab Sunni powers
   actually want to reach a settlement that is favorable to certain core
   Israeli security interests. Privately, Gulf State leaders, along with
   Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco, appear willing to see Hamas eradicated on
   the battlefield but are restricted in facilitating that outcome by the
   pro-Palestinian sentiments and massive Iranian and Russian
   disinformation campaigns among their populaces. What they are not
   restricted from doing is helping to implement a post-war interim
   solution for Gaza that safeguards Palestinian interests while
   preventing Hamas’s resurgence.

   the funds and political support it has depended on for years and to
   foster alternative forms of Sunni political Islamism. Qatar mediated
   the [139]initial release of two American hostages on Oct. 20 and two
   more Israelis on Oct. 23. Doha, Qatar’s capital, is not only the home
   of Hamas’s political wing, but Qatar gives it [140]access to the
   international financial system. Although Iran is a military patron of
   Hamas, it lacks the key conduits to the international financial system
   that Qatar provides.

   leader or face US wrath

   In the early post-Arab Spring period, the Qataris unfortunately
   militants in Egypt, [144]Libya, [145]Tunisia, and Gaza. Those choices
   to back Islamist militants are mostly associated with the previous emir
   — the current emir’s father — and his advisers. Over the last few
   years, as the current emir has cemented his rule, he has been
   distancing himself from the confrontational choices of his father and
   has focused on building Qatar’s diplomatic capacity and global image.
   Qatari elites truly wish to show the world that they have turned over a
   new leaf, building on the image they tried to present when they hosted
   the 2022 World Cup. Now we should gracefully allow the new emir to
   fully turn the page and get credit for doing so.

   A Qatari-led pan-Arab condominium for Gaza’s governance can become the
   basis for a broader regional settlement, which could finally end the
   post-Arab Spring [147]Emirati-Qatari Cold War, in turn helping to
   contain Iran and its proxy Hezbollah. Evicting Iranian influence from
   Gaza and elsewhere in the Arab Middle East, such as Yemen, Syria, and
   Lebanon, would create conditions regionally that are more conducive to
   a larger Arab-Israeli settlement that satisfies Palestinian national
   aspirations and Israeli security concerns, while reducing the
   arrangements over Gaza can create trust and diplomatic channels that in
   a few years’ time can form the groundwork of an
   Israeli-Palestinian-pan-Arab peace deal, which would correct the
   dangerous dynamics of the Abraham Accords, which ignored Palestinian
   issues.

   Many on the American and Israeli right will balk at Qatari involvement,
   as it has long been their agenda to isolate the Qataris and further
   punish them for their prior support of militant Sunni Islamism. To make
   sure that the Qataris definitively want to turn the page, it is
   essential to spell out the intense sanctions they would face if they
   revert to funding or harboring terrorists. At present, it is simply
   impossible to ignore Qatar’s role in the Middle East or to eradicate
   the Muslim Brotherhood ideologically, philanthropically, and
   educationally in Gaza or elsewhere. (Though distinct from Hamas, the
   Muslim Brotherhood is the ideological precursor, and umbrella movement,
   from which Hamas sprung.)

   Meanwhile, Israel lacks the regional connections and international
   levers to bring about a stable postwar state for Gaza. And most
   Israelis do not want Israel to occupy Gaza indefinitely. At the end of
   the war, Israel should receive regional security guarantees, an
   upgrading of American and British defense commitments, in exchange for
   recognition of both the pan-Arab condominium’s temporary administrative
   control and eventual Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza.

   In this era of [149]global enduring disorder, each new crisis injects
   volatility into the international system and empowers spoiler powers
   like Russia and Iran, which actively promote chaos for chaos’s sake.
   The role of mature diplomacy in times like these is to push combatants
   toward the least bad option. With a little help from our friends, both
   hostage releases and the end of hostilities are within reach.
