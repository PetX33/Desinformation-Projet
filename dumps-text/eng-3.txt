   “Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme
   excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s
   resistance without fighting.”
   – Sun Tzu

   “The Art of War,” written by Sun Tzu in roughly the fifth century B.C.,
   calls for military commanders to avoid direct confrontation, reminding
   the reader that the most effective campaign is the one that is won by
   indirect methods to break the enemy’s will to fight before the battle
   begins. In many ways, this principle remains the main objective of
   covert actions, propaganda and information operations.

   In February 2021, Twitter published a report documenting 373 accounts
   believed to be part of a coordinated effort by Iran, Armenia and Russia
   to conduct information operations. The concepts of information
   operations vary, but most definitions agree that those operations aim
   to diminish an enemy’s cohesion and willingness to fight. U.S. Joint
   Chiefs of Staff publications define information operations as the use
   of “information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of
   operations to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making
   of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own.”
   This definition presents information operations as a two-sided
   strategy; both offensive and defensive.

   Today’s Russian information operations have these same objectives.
   According to T.S. Allen and A.J. Moore, authors of “Victory without
   Casualties: Russia’s Information Operations,” Russia, conscious of its
   incapability to balance against the United States’ regular military
   capacities, has relied on its significant expertise in the use of
   information warfare as an asymmetric method to counterbalance
   defensively and offensively the West’s primacy in military resources.
   Unlike the American case, where information operations primarily
   support traditional military and intelligence operations, Russia
   understands information operations as an essential piece of state power
   projection. It seeks to align military, diplomatic and economic efforts
   to information operations objectives. For Russia, information
   operations are valid also as a defensive weapon. In a well-known
   article, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of the Russian
   armed forces, stated that Western powers are the ones that use
   information operations to affect Russia’s interests. In fact, as
   highlighted by Hans Klein, an associate professor in the School of
   Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, both East and
   West accuse each other of conducting information operations to weaken
   each other’s positions. This struggle can be traced back to the Cold
   War.

   Covert propaganda during the Cold War

   During the Cold War, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union relied on
   propaganda as an information operations tool to undermine and degrade
   their adversaries’ will to fight. By the 1970s, BBC broadcasts to the
   East bloc were listened to by almost 50% of the Soviet population,
   despite Soviet efforts to jam these transmissions. It is also true that
   the West effectively used propaganda to disseminate information on the
   benefits of capitalism. For example, Western films were used to
   propagate capitalism’s and democracy’s benefits, and to demonize
   communism. In the 1950s, the CIA bought the movie rights to George
   Orwell’s book “Animal Farm” to use as a propaganda tool in the East
   bloc. Western efforts to undermine communist governments in the East
   proved detrimental to Soviet performance during the Cold War.

   According to Christopher M. Andrew, a history professor from England,
   and Vasili Mitrokhin, a former Soviet intelligence chief who defected
   to the United Kingdom, Soviet information operations during the Cold
   War were oriented toward achieving three main objectives: the
   fragmentation of NATO, promoting the communist agenda, and the
   subversion of nonaligned countries. The primary tool to perform these
   operations was the KGB-controlled Society for Cultural Relations
   Abroad. Some of the tactics included false flag operations, such as the
   attack on Pope John Paul II, which according to Taras Kuzio, professor
   of political science at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy,
   was deliberately attributed to a Turkish nationalist who turned out to
   have links to East bloc intelligence agencies. Other tactics included
   supporting separatist and nationalist movements by financing
   information operations, and the intensive use of dezinformatsiya, or
   disinformation, campaigns that included blaming the spread of HIV on
   the CIA. During the Cold War, a large part of information operations
   was also oriented toward influencing local populations in the Soviet
   Union and satellite countries. The main objectives of this strategy
   were to consolidate popular support, build resilience in case of war
   and build resistance against the West’s information operations,
   according to Center for European Policy Analysis fellows Irina Borogan
   and Andrei Soldatov. These can be considered information operation
   defensive measures.

   The Soviet Union also executed information operations in an offensive
   mode, mainly through the use of active measures, which involve overt
   and covert operations to influence public opinion. One of the main
   instruments of this strategy was the design and exploitation of front
   organizations that promoted Soviet policies. The World Peace Council,
   founded in 1949 to promote peace globally, was de facto controlled by
   the Communist Party and ruled by Soviet officials. The Soviets used
   this organization to encourage positions against the liberal Western
   economic order, to aid leftist “liberation” movements and to exploit
   fears of nuclear weapons in NATO countries, according to the U.S. State
   Department.

   Other active measures included forgery of official documents and
   reports. For instance, the Soviet Union used authentic official U.S.
   documents as models to fabricate false war plans designed to build
   tension between countries. Agents of influence were another tool for
   conducting information operations. These agents recruited sympathizers,
   who weren’t aware that they were being used to spread disinformation.
   The World Peace Council’s campaign, including demonstrations against
   enhanced radiation weapons in the U.S., was an example of the Soviet
   use of agents of influence. Finally, the Soviet Union relied on
   traditional active measures such as distributing misinformation and
   fake news through conventional media outlets. While these campaigns
   were directed at domestic news outlets, Soviet agents also targeted the
   foreign press, inserting falsely attributed material. For instance, the
   TASS news agency oversaw the global spread of Soviet propaganda. It had
   a substantial overseas representation with more than 400 staff and
   correspondents in 126 countries. Many of them were connected to Soviet
   state security organs, including foreign intelligence.

   Information operations in Putin’s Russia

   The collapse and disintegration of the Soviet Union led to political
   turmoil in Russia. Still, intelligence agencies, particularly the KGB
   (now known as FSB), maintained profound influence on Russia’s political
   structure. Before becoming Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin was
   elected prime minister in 1999. He is a former KGB officer and once
   served as FSB director. His personal experience during the Cold War
   profoundly shapes current Russian information operations. According to
   journalist Chris Bowlby, Putin’s worldview was formed by the fall of
   the Berlin Wall, the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the power
   vacuum that followed, which he experienced while serving as a KGB
   officer in East Germany in 1989. The disintegration of the Soviet
   Union, which many Russian scholars think resulted from Western
   information operations, may have reinforced his vision on the crucial
   role that these types of operations would have in the future. In
   particular, the Soviet collapse demonstrated how vulnerable a country
   can become when its leadership breaks. This is absolutely linked to the
   new way in which Russia conducts information operations. While they
   remain a centerpiece of Russia’s foreign policy activities, today’s
   information operations aim to have a kinetic effect in addition to the
   traditional subjective influence on an adversary’s social cohesion.
   Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 provides paradigmatic examples of
   the four distinct characteristics of contemporary Russian information
   operations that differentiate them from those of the Cold War era, not
   only for achieving strategic objectives but also for ensuring tactical
   victories.

   First, Russia increasingly controls mass media to distribute and
   propagate its messages by developing news outlets that act as agents of
   Russian influence. For example, Russia Today (RT) broadcasts to more
   than 100 countries and has been marked for its involvement in Russian
   information campaigns. A recent report by the U.S. Office of the
   Director of National Intelligence found that RT news outlets played a
   vital role in the Russian strategy to meddle in the U.S. national
   elections in 2016. According to the report, RT mixed real information,
   hacked information, and fake or false information while amplifying its
   messaging through social media to undermine the U.S. public’s faith in
   the democratic process.

   Second, modern information operations aim to control the Russian
   diaspora in former Soviet republics. Russia uses information operations
   to create a false narrative of aggression against Russian diaspora
   communities to justify subsequent military actions. These operations
   aim not only to justify this narrative internally, but also to
   legitimize it in international eyes. In Georgia (2008) and Ukraine
   (2014), to justify its interventions, Russia had been conducting
   information operations for years before actually deploying troops.

   Third, social media has given a whole new meaning to Russian
   information operations. Social media outlets such as Facebook and
   Twitter are used to propagate narratives that appeal to emotions deeply
   rooted in Russian social psychology. The use of emotional stories
   reinforces the potent ideas of the glorious Russian past and Russia
   being a victim of adversaries’ aggression. For example, Chris Collison,
   from the Jackson School of International Studies, states that during
   the Crimean campaign, Russian media made the fantastical claim that
   Ukrainian soldiers had crucified the child of a family who supported
   the Russian intervention. According to Julien Nocetti, a research
   fellow at the French Institute of International Relations, Russia
   employed a similar strategy to attribute a gas attack in Syria to
   Syrian opposition forces.

   Finally, Russia operates information campaigns as a tool of hybrid
   warfare operations. There isn’t a unique definition of hybrid warfare.
   The Norwegian Institute of International Affairs defines it as “the
   synchronized use of multiple instruments of power tailored to specific
   vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of societal functions to
   achieve synergistic effects.” Russia has successfully conducted
   information operations that created mayhem in the adversary’s military
   and corrupted its chain of command. In Crimea, Russia’s use of
   information operations, combined with parastatal troops, special forces
   and the active role of the Russian diaspora, rendered local Ukrainian
   armed forces virtually useless. The local Ukrainian military faced
   unidentified troops and civic-military demonstrations, received
   confusing information from mass media, and found its communication
   channels with other units had been jammed. As a result, local units
   didn’t fight, and just one Ukrainian soldier was killed. Russia
   achieved an almost flawless victory according to Sun Tzu’s definition.

   Contemporary Russian and Soviet Cold War operations

   Russia uses information operations to asymmetrically balance the West’s
   capabilities, promote its own interests abroad and consolidate the
   domestic political scene. It has shown the world how a conflict can be
   won with little violence, by breaking the enemy’s leadership and
   creating a massive fog of war. Russia has also proved how effective
   information operations are at deepening preexisting societal fractures
   and how that can affect democracy and even the rule of law.
   Additionally, it has proved to the world how social media plays a vital
   role in propagating cleverly tailored messages and how traditional
   media can be used to spread disinformation or misinformation. Russia
   has shown that information operations can have more tangible results
   than in the past and may be used in a kinetic way with immediate
   tactical results.

   Contemporary Russian information operations are deeply rooted in their
   Soviet predecessor. As in the Soviet past, the Russian government still
   considers itself a victim of Western information operations to
   undermine its sphere of influence. Mark Galeotti, a writer and lecturer
   on Russian security affairs, argues that Russian authorities see the
   United States’ push for transparency, democratization and the fight
   against corruption as tools of subversion, which can be linked to
   Ukraine, Georgia and the Balkan states moving politically closer to the
   West. This is not the only link to the past. RT can be traced back to
   TASS and APN, media outlets that distributed tailored Soviet
   information around the world. With its speed, social media has
   revolutionized the way disinformation is spread. But the objectives
   remain similar to those of the Cold War agents of influence. Moreover,
   the current trend of using information operations to influence the
   Russian diaspora abroad is intimately related to its defensive
   countering of Western information operations in the East bloc during
   the Cold War.

   One factor in Russia’s modern use of information operations is that it
   can be used at a tactical level, encompassing military actions and
   achieving kinetic power that can weaken an adversary’s armed forces.
   Still, this unique characteristic was developed as a result of a
   phenomenon that can also be traced back to the Cold War: Russia’s
   inability to compete on equal terms with the West in the conventional
   military arena. For Putin, Sun Tzu’s principle of winning without
   fighting has turned out to be not an option but a necessity, even
   though it apparently does not exclude the use of kinetic means.
