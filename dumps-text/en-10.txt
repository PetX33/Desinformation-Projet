Qatar is the key to peace in postwar Gaza

American and British diplomats should be working on creating a pan-Arab
coalition to administer postwar Gaza — and Qatar’s role would be particularly
important.

   Even in the best of times, diplomats struggle to get adversaries to
   compromise for mutually beneficial solutions. Human selfishness,
   paranoia, in-group solidarity, and shortsightedness make suboptimal
   outcomes more likely. Look at Israel and Gaza: Amid massacres, forced
   deportations, a hostage crisis, disinformation, and arguably the worst
   outbreak of online ethnic hatred since the invention of the internet,
   it would seem nearly impossible to undertake the compromises needed to
   free Israeli hostages, prevent a humanitarian tragedy for Palestinian
   civilians, and forge an optimal solution for postwar governance in
   Gaza.

   Yet, we mustn’t lose hope. Plans are being negotiated by entrepreneurs
   and experienced go-betweens tying comprehensive hostage release to
   postwar humanitarian assistance for Gaza. They can, however, be brought
   to fruition only if they include postwar interim governance
   arrangements that empower Arab allies to take responsibility for Gaza
   and to facilitate an end to hostilities.

   American and British diplomats should be working on creating a Qatari,
   Emirati, Saudi, and Egyptian coalition — known in this context as a
   condominium — to administer postwar Gaza’s foreign affairs, borders,
   health care, infrastructure, and education for five to 10 years while
   rebuilding, rooting out Hamas, and preparations for elections are
   undertaken in parallel. Lessons from post-conflict states that have
   held elections too early — for example, Libya and Egypt after the Arab
   Spring — should serve as a warning against a rush to turn things over
   to the Palestinian Authority or to bring about elections too soon.

   This urgent diplomacy does not have to touch the intractable issues
   concerning the final status of the West Bank, the Israeli settlements
   there, or even the final status of Gaza.

   Unlike in previous Arab-Israeli Wars, the main Arab Sunni powers
   actually want to reach a settlement that is favorable to certain core
   Israeli security interests. Privately, Gulf State leaders, along with
   Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco, appear willing to see Hamas eradicated on
   the battlefield but are restricted in facilitating that outcome by the
   pro-Palestinian sentiments and massive Iranian and Russian
   disinformation campaigns among their populaces. What they are not
   restricted from doing is helping to implement a post-war interim
   solution for Gaza that safeguards Palestinian interests while
   preventing Hamas’s resurgence.

   Qatari involvement, in particular, is essential to starve Hamas of the
   funds and political support it has depended on for years and to foster
   alternative forms of Sunni political Islamism. Qatar mediated the
   initial release of two American hostages on Oct. 20 and two more
   Israelis on Oct. 23. Doha, Qatar’s capital, is not only the home of
   Hamas’s political wing, but Qatar gives it access to the international
   financial system. Although Iran is a military patron of Hamas, it lacks
   the key conduits to the international financial system that Qatar
   provides.

   In the early post-Arab Spring period, the Qataris unfortunately funded
   the Muslim Brotherhood and assorted armed Sunni militants in Egypt,
   Libya, Tunisia, and Gaza. Those choices to back Islamist militants are
   mostly associated with the previous emir — the current emir’s father —
   and his advisers. Over the last few years, as the current emir has
   cemented his rule, he has been distancing himself from the
   confrontational choices of his father and has focused on building
   Qatar’s diplomatic capacity and global image. Qatari elites truly wish
   to show the world that they have turned over a new leaf, building on
   the image they tried to present when they hosted the 2022 World Cup.
   Now we should gracefully allow the new emir to fully turn the page and
   get credit for doing so.

   A Qatari-led pan-Arab condominium for Gaza’s governance can become the
   basis for a broader regional settlement, which could finally end the
   post-Arab Spring Emirati-Qatari Cold War, in turn helping to contain
   Iran and its proxy Hezbollah. Evicting Iranian influence from Gaza and
   elsewhere in the Arab Middle East, such as Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon,
   would create conditions regionally that are more conducive to a larger
   Arab-Israeli settlement that satisfies Palestinian national aspirations
   and Israeli security concerns, while reducing the disordering potential
   of Iran and Russia. In fact, the interim arrangements over Gaza can
   create trust and diplomatic channels that in a few years’ time can form
   the groundwork of an Israeli-Palestinian-pan-Arab peace deal, which
   would correct the dangerous dynamics of the Abraham Accords, which
   ignored Palestinian issues.

   Many on the American and Israeli right will balk at Qatari involvement,
   as it has long been their agenda to isolate the Qataris and further
   punish them for their prior support of militant Sunni Islamism. To make
   sure that the Qataris definitively want to turn the page, it is
   essential to spell out the intense sanctions they would face if they
   revert to funding or harboring terrorists. At present, it is simply
   impossible to ignore Qatar’s role in the Middle East or to eradicate
   the Muslim Brotherhood ideologically, philanthropically, and
   educationally in Gaza or elsewhere. (Though distinct from Hamas, the
   Muslim Brotherhood is the ideological precursor, and umbrella movement,
   from which Hamas sprung.)

   Meanwhile, Israel lacks the regional connections and international
   levers to bring about a stable postwar state for Gaza. And most
   Israelis do not want Israel to occupy Gaza indefinitely. At the end of
   the war, Israel should receive regional security guarantees, an
   upgrading of American and British defense commitments, in exchange for
   recognition of both the pan-Arab condominium’s temporary administrative
   control and eventual Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza.

   In this era of global enduring disorder, each new crisis injects
   volatility into the international system and empowers spoiler powers
   like Russia and Iran, which actively promote chaos for chaos’s sake.
   The role of mature diplomacy in times like these is to push combatants
   toward the least bad option. With a little help from our friends, both
   hostage releases and the end of hostilities are within reach.
