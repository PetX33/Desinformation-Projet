False Claims Around Israel Attacks Include Recycled Videos and a Game Clip

   Graphic imagery and footage have flooded social media since Hamas
   terrorists attacked Israelis. Bogus claims are also circulating and
   risk obscuring real evidence of atrocities.

   In the days since [18]Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than 1,200
   people in sweeping assaults on kibbutzim, a music festival, towns and
   other places, violent images and graphic videos have [19]flooded social
   media.

   So too have false and misleading information, old and unrelated videos
   and photos with inaccurate claims, and fabricated assertions about the
   involvement of countries like the United States and Ukraine — adding
   confusion and deception to an already chaotic moment.

   The false information circulating online risks clouding [20]real
   evidence of atrocities that is emerging as Israeli soldiers retake
   control of places that were attacked: videos and photos, corroborated
   by witness accounts, that show that Palestinian gunmen attacked and
   killed Israeli civilians in large numbers. Soldiers and emergency
   workers are still recovering the dead, including children, in many
   communities.

   Here’s a look at some of the inaccurate material circulating online.
