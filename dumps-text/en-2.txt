Disinformation and Hate Speech on Social Media Contribute to Inciting War
Crimes Against Gaza

   Oct 13, 2023 Tamara Kharroub

   During major events like violent conflict, there is a vacuum of
   verified and accurate information, as well as high interest and
   emotions. As the fog of war and polarization make it difficult to
   verify information and find credible or reliable sources, social media
   platforms become vital information spaces. But those platforms also
   become part of the information warfare where disinformation and fake
   content are rampant, hate speech and incitement spread, and extreme and
   graphic content gets amplified by the algorithms of social media
   platforms and garner the most engagement and attention. Social media
   users share unverified, misleading, or miscaptioned content, spread
   doctored images and altered documents, and amplify baseless claims. In
   the coverage of the recent Hamas attack on Israel and the latter’s
   criminal bombardment of Gaza, the amount of disinformation, false
   content, and violent hate speech on social media platforms has reached
   unprecedented levels. This type of content incites further violence,
   manufactures support for war crimes, and impacts real world policy
   decisions. The world is witnessing a new phase of the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and social media content is fanning the
   flames of further violence.

Unprecedented Scale and Speed of Disinformation

   There is a flood of misinformation and falsehoods circulating on social
   media, claiming to show the recent events in Israel and Palestine,
   including mischaracterized content, misleading captions, false images,
   out-of-context and old videos, and video game footage. The level of
   disinformation, especially on X (formerly Twitter), has never been seen
   before and is spreading at accelerated speed due to its graphic and
   emotional nature, which in turn widens its reach. According to some
   analysts, 20 percent of the accounts participating in these
   conversations online are fake and mostly operating on X and TikTok.
   Additionally, there have been tens of millions of posts about the
   events in Israel and Palestine, and the enormous amounts of
   unverifiable content, and the speed at which it is spreading, far
   outpace content moderation measures by social media platforms,
   especially after waves of layoffs at many tech companies like X and
   Meta, which impacted content and safety teams.

   While disinformation spreads on all social media sites, X is the most
   impactful as it has been the primary platform for political content,
   where users go first to find information on breaking news and
   developing events. However, after being acquired by Elon Musk, X has
   become the platform with the largest amount of disinformation and hate
   speech. Musk, who reposts far-right antisemitic accounts and verifiably
   false content, has eliminated teams that deal with disinformation and
   human rights and safety at the company, and instituted platform changes
   that made it easier for false information to spread. For example, the
   introduction of the $8 per month premium subscription in exchange for
   the “verified” account with the blue checkmark label boosts the
   subscribers’ posts to the top of the feed and makes it difficult for
   users to distinguish between fake accounts and vetted accounts. Some
   accounts with blue checkmarks have been found to impersonate news
   outlets and masquerade as journalists disseminating false information
   and fake reports. The eligibility of verified accounts to monetize
   their content along with the profit-driven algorithm further increases
   the spread of false and hateful content as posters are incentivized by
   sharing content that is more likely to generate view counts.

   Moreover, X now relies heavily on user-driven content moderation and
   fact-checking through the Community Notes feature, but notes are often
   added only after false content has been viewed by hundreds of thousands
   if not millions of users, while the false or hateful content remains on
   the platform and continues to be viewed. The removal of headlines on
   external links, reportedly for aesthetic reasons, could be further
   exacerbating the problem as articles are only represented by images
   without context. Musk’s efforts since taking over Twitter (now X) have
   essentially removed any existing guardrails on disinformation and hate
   speech, made it more difficult for researchers to study content and
   patterns on the platform, and made this information environment more
   susceptible to exploitation by malicious actors.

   The type of false content that goes viral on social media platforms
   tends to be graphic and extreme, and is intended to inflate one side’s
   own power or exaggerate the other side’s crimes. For example, images
   showing children in cages claiming they were Israeli children abducted
   by Hamas were proven to be false. So were a doctored false Press
   Release attributed to the White House, an account posing as the
   Jerusalem Post claiming Israeli prime minister was taken to hospital, a
   video claiming to show a Hamas fighter with an Israeli girl that was
   actually posted on TikTok months earlier, and images claiming to show
   Israeli generals captured by Hamas were actually from Azerbaijan. There
   also was a video of a beheading of a child claiming Hamas committed the
   crime, which was actually from 2016 in Syria.

   While some organizations have been conducting factchecking of social
   media content (for example through reverse image searches), they are
   not able to keep up and the risk of artificial intelligence
   (AI)-generated content that looks realistic is a real possibility.
   Additionally, most of the (presumed) primary footage was first shared
   privately on message apps like Telegram and WhatsApp and then posted on
   social media platforms. In these cases, is it difficult to fact-check
   or verify the authenticity, credibility, and source of the content, and
   whether it gets spun on social media to push a certain narrative. What
   becomes even more challenging to vet online are secondhand posts that
   refer to unverified content. For example, the story about 40 babies
   found beheaded has not been confirmed or verified by any official
   account and yet continues to circulate on social media (with at least
   44 million impressions and 100 thousand reposts) and is reported by
   mainstream media outlets. The claim was even referenced by US President
   Biden in his support for Israel’s indiscriminate bombardment of the
   besieged Gaza Strip, where more than 2 million Palestinians live, 45
   percent of whom are children. The gruesome nature of this story
   contributes to incitement and the justification of war crimes that
   Israel is committing against civilians in Gaza.

Hate Speech and the Silencing of Palestinian Narratives

   In addition to disinformation, hateful and violent content and cyber
   harassment have been rampant on social media platforms. Some
   organizations have identified thousands of cases of hate speech
   including antisemitism, islamophobia, and anti-Palestinian racism,
   especially on X. There are concerns about the rise in antisemitic
   content online spreading conspiracy theories and justifying violence
   against Jewish people around the world, while calls to kill all
   Palestinians and flatten Gaza as well as other dehumanizing and
   genocidal language roam freely on social media (sanctioned by statement
   from prominent political figures such as Nikky Haley, Lindsey Graham,
   and Marco Rubio, among others).

   For Palestinians the threat is two-fold. First, anti-Palestinian racism
   has become normalized in the American and western psyche that they are
   rarely treated as equal human beings by the media or politicians, and
   that is reflected on social media and their content moderation norms,
   leading to an alarming proliferation of this dangerous rhetoric, with
   no efforts to address it. Second, the conflation between antisemitism
   and legitimate criticism of Israeli crimes against Palestinian
   civilians (heightened by the adoption of the International Holocaust
   Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism by many states
   and organization), leads to the silencing of Palestinian voices. There
   are already reports of the removal and shadow banning of Palestinian
   speech on social media platforms, while at the same time blatantly
   anti-Palestinian and genocidal language is permitted and widespread.
   Hate speech and incitement against Palestinians in the Hebrew social
   media sphere is even more blatant and prevalent, with hardly any
   restrictions by social media companies.

   This trend is particularly concerning because marginalized and
   oppressed populations like the Palestinians rely on social media
   platforms to share their grievances and document human rights abuses
   against them. This is important, especially when mainstream media
   outlets continue to present biased accounts, exclude Palestinian voices
   and stories, and perpetuate narratives and reporting practices that
   dehumanize the Palestinian people and undermine their suffering while
   decontextualizing events. More concerning, Israel has cut off the
   electricity in the Gaza Strip, creating an internet blackout. As Israel
   devastates the strip, flattening entire residential neighborhoods,
   bombing schools and hospitals, and cutting off food and water, the
   atrocities and humanitarian disaster for the people of Gaza will only
   get worse. At a time when western governments are ignoring Israeli
   atrocities against Palestinian civilians and mainstream media outlets
   have no reporters there, the Israeli internet blackout is alarming and
   will serve to give Israel cover as it commits outright massacres. At a
   time of a fast-developing crisis, decision-making is based on the
   available information; the dangerous dehumanization of Palestinians,
   coupled with their silencing, contributes to the narrative of
   supporting war crimes and will have harmful and long-lasting
   consequences.
