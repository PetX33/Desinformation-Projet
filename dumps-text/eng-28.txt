China Uses ‘Deceptive’ Methods to Sow Disinformation, U.S. Says

   The accusations reflect worry in Washington that China’s information
   operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States.

   The State Department accused China on Thursday of using “deceptive and
   coercive methods” to shape the global information environment, by
   acquiring stakes in foreign newspapers and television networks, using
   major social media platforms to promote its views and exerting pressure
   on international organizations and media outlets to silence critics of
   Beijing.

   The accusations, detailed in [12]a report by the department’s Global
   Engagement Center, reflect worry in Washington that China’s information
   operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States and
   to democratic principles around the world by promoting “digital
   authoritarianism.”

   China not only pushes its own propaganda, the report said, but exports
   digital surveillance tools to police information and people online.
   Although many of the tactics detailed are not new, the report warned
   that they could “lead nations to make decisions that subordinate their
   economic and security interests to Beijing.”

   “Every country has the right and every right to tell its story to the
   world, but a nation’s narrative should be facts, and it should rise or
   fall on its own merits,” James P. Rubin, the coordinator of the Global
   Engagement Center, said at a briefing. Referring to the People’s
   Republic of China, he went on: “By contrast, the P.R.C. advances
   coercive techniques and increasingly outright lies.”

   The report echoes a raft of recent studies detailing the growing — and
   shifting — scope of China’s information campaigns. It came a day after
   officials [13]disclosed in a Senate briefing that Chinese hackers who
   gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo
   and other officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State
   Department alone.

   According to the State Department’s report released on Thursday,
   China’s efforts have evolved from a primary focus on promoting or
   defending the country’s political views on issues like Taiwan and Hong
   Kong to one that aims to sow disinformation to discredit the United
   States at home and abroad.
