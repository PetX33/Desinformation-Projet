Misinformation and Disinformation—What They Mean for the Israel-Hamas War

Bad information of any kind, intentional or accidental, leads to a “polluted
information environment” that can make it hard to tell what’s real and what’s
not, says BU’s Lee McIntyre

   October 23, 2023

   Twitter Facebook

   Editor’s note, October 25: This story was updated with new information
   about the hospital explosion.

   In the weeks since Hamas militants stormed Israel, videos, images, and
   firsthand accounts of attacks and counterattacks have flooded social
   media platforms, giving people around the world direct insight into the
   war. The problem, however, is that not all of it is true.

   And when accounts filled with falsehoods mix with the truth, they
   “pollute the entire information ecosystem,” making it harder for
   everyone to tell fact from fiction, says Lee McIntyre, a research
   fellow at Boston University’s [9]Center for Philosophy & History of
   Science.

   “One of the dangers here is that disinformation doesn’t just get you to
   believe a false thing is true; it also gets you to believe a true thing
   is false. That’s the poison that disinformation puts in the
   atmosphere,” McIntyre says.

   There’s an important distinction between the words disinformation and
   misinformation, he says: disinformation is an intentional falsehood,
   whereas misinformation is an accident.

   “Misinformation is when someone shares a falsehood, believing it to be
   true. Maybe they’ve been duped by someone else, but it’s information
   they think is true that they pass along,” he says. “Disinformation, on
   the other hand, is an intentional falsehood that someone created and
   shared in hopes of deceiving other people, for a purpose.”

   Both can be—and often are—at play during especially fraught global
   events, such as a presidential election or an emerging war. But,
   McIntyre says, disinformation in particular leaves insidious damage in
   its wake: “One thing that disinformation does is it erodes not only
   your knowledge base, but your trust in other people to tell you the
   truth, because sometimes disinformation comes in a neat little package
   of a conspiracy theory.”

   In this polluted information environment, truth and falsehoods exist
   side-by-side, and it can be difficult for even usually trustworthy
   sources to discern what’s what. Take, for example, [10]the destruction
   at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, on October 17. Almost immediately
   after the blast, which killed hundreds, Hamas blamed Israel for the
   explosion. News outlets in the United States and elsewhere initially
   reported that the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike, only to
   consistent with a standard Israeli airstrike. [12]President Biden later
   supported Israel’s assertion that the explosion was caused by a failed
   rocket from an armed Palestinian group, but further analysis by
   the [13]New York Times and [14]Al-Jazeera of video evidence presented
   by Israeli forces refutes Israel’s claim. As of this writing, neither
   news outlet has reported definitively who is responsible for the blast,
   and the United Nations has called for an independent international
   investigation into the explosion.

   I personally think the most dangerous part of disinformation is the way
   it can make us cynical, because it plays right into the authoritarians’
   hands.

   Lee McIntyre

   In this case, determining who is to blame for the explosion has real,
   and global, humanitarian consequences, and it takes time to sift
   through evidence and determine what’s real and what’s not. But in a
   society where millions of people can access a firehose of unvetted
   information in the palm of their hands, McIntyre says, bad actors take
   advantage of this confusing and convoluted influx of information to
   move public opinion.

   “I personally think the most dangerous part of disinformation is the
   way it can make us cynical, because it plays right into the
   authoritarians’ hands. Authoritarians love to use disinformation—maybe
   they can convince you [to believe their narrative], but even if they
   can’t convince you, they can demoralize you and make you feel like
   there’s no use even fighting back,” he says.

   Writing in [15]Time magazine, BU’s [16]Joan Donovan, a renowned expert
   in online misinformation and disinformation campaigns, says that the
   torrent of “true horror, violent pronunciations, sadness, and
   disinformation” online when talking about Hamas and Israel on social
   media is more than the “fog of war.” A College of Communication
   assistant professor, Donovan writes that “we are involved in an
   information war playing out across all social media platforms every
   day,” often as unwitting participants who share what may be dubious
   posts.

   Disinformation is everywhere, and thanks to artificial
   intelligence–powered tools, it’s easier to make than ever, McIntyre
   says, but he urges people not to lose hope. His new book, [17]On
   Disinformation: How to Fight for Truth and Protect Democracy (MIT
   Press, 2023), outlines straightforward ways people can sift through
   information to determine what’s real.

   He advises people to look for reliable sources, and understand that
   even they may have biases, in addition to taking a more active role by,
   for example, pushing Congress to better regulate information on social
   media platforms.

   “This is a depressing topic, and I get that,” he says. “But it is also
   something that we can learn to fight back against. And the primary way
   to fight back is to expose [something as] disinformation. As I often
   say, ‘You cannot win a disinformation war unless you realize you’re in
   one.’”

       The hospital blast hoax should be in a How To Destroy Your
       Reputation 101 textbook. With even a modicum of basic critical
       thinking and a low enough journalistic standard, this could’ve been
       easily averted. But our media was ITCHING to believe a certain
       story, and so they went ahead and published this fake story not
       only as a headline, but a banner headline. As we have seen, this
       journalistic malpractice has true real world consequences.
       After this debacle, I, and I hope many others, can’t trust what
       comes out from our mainstream media anymore. A game is being
       played.
       By the way, this article itself is peddling misinformation. First,
       the hospital wasn’t “destroyed.” The failed rocket landed on the
       hospital’s parking lot, charring only a handful of cars with no
       structural damage to the hospital. Only a few windows were blown
       out, but nothing more.
       Second, the evidence indicates that the rocket came from the
       Palestinian Islamic Jihad, not Hamas. They are two different
       terrorist groups. Hamas just took advantage of this event to make
       fools of western media.
         1.

            Thanks for reading and for your comment. We’ve updated the
            story to clarify the destruction at (not “of”) the hospital
            and that US intelligence currently suggests the rocket was
            fired by an armed Palestinian group. – Andrew Thurston,
            Editor, The Brink
         2.
        J
            I agree that the mainstream media is not to be trusted as
            there’s a bigger game in session and we’re all the victims of
            it. But for you to follow up by saying that this article is
            peddling misinformation and then continue to peddle
            misinformation yourself, suggests that you’re still a victim
            of this foolish game. You have drawn your conclusions based on
            what a few said even though there have been numerous accounts
            of others disproving what exactly happened to that hospital.
            There have been several AI generated pictures and scenarios
            dispersed all over the web and “big names” who are impactful
            mouthpieces are posting the images as well. It seems you’ve
            drawn your conclusions based on “the evidence” or words from a
            select few only. Groups who have committed the crimes will
            generally always reject the claim that they are responsible so
            we are in no position to decide who is telling the truth and
            then comment on an article about misinformation and
            disinformation in such a way.
            Like I said though, I agree with your statements about
            mainstream media being corrupt and not to be trusted but I do
            hope we genuinely understand that and avoid the traps.

       Getting Congress to regulate misinformation seems directly
       antithetical to the foundations of this country. Yes, false
       information is bad and even dangerous, but even more dangerous is
       to assign one person or group the absolute right to decide what is
       right and wrong.
       As we saw during the COVID pandemic, experts can and do get
       fundamental concepts horribly wrong all the time. There is no
       substitute for an educated, informed and intellectually critical
       public.
       You cannot outsource critical thinking to others.
         1.
        J
            I second this 100%! It is indeed a very dangerous idea to give
            1 person or group such power. People tend to be greedy and
            especially when having access to so much power, they will take
            advantage of it. I mean, we’re witnessing this very phenomenon
            happening before our eyes today. There should be no place for
            ideas of this nature in this land of liberty. Though, I fear
            for the future since we are already heading towards that path.
         2.
        The Perpetual Student
            “You cannot outsource critical thinking to others.” Well said!
            Sadly, the concept is largely absent from academia today. It
            is no wonder that it finds its way into the political realm as
            well. The free-flow of ideas, good and bad, is essential to
            democracy. Academia needs to teach the skills necessary to
            discern truth from falsehood.
            Truth is another concept being lost to subjectivity — e.g.,
            “your truth” and “my truth.” There is only one truth and it is
            the obligation of every individual, not only to pursue truth,
            but to find and affirm truth.
    3.
   S
       I must point out that even within the lines of this article, which
       claims to be neutral for most, a discernible narrative emerges. It
       begins with the very first line, referring to ‘Hamas militants.’
       It’s important to note that Hamas has been officially recognized as
       a terrorist organization by both the United States and the European
       Union and use the right definition while writing about this topic.
       The article later mentions a ‘failed rocket from an armed
       Palestinian group,’ which happens to be the Islamic Jihad, another
       recognized terrorist organization. While many media outlets and
       magazines have adopted the correct terminology to describe such
       groups in their reports, it seems that BU Today has not followed
       this approach, and It’s definitely unfortunate.
    4.
   N
       Why can’t you just call them terrorists. They are not an armed
       Palestinian group they are terrorists. The way you frame your words
       matter and in choosing to make this distinction you have shown your
       bias.
