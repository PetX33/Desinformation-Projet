   A team of Israeli contractors who claim to have manipulated more than
   30 elections around the world using hacking, sabotage and automated
   disinformation on social media has been exposed in a new investigation.

   The unit is run by Tal Hanan, a 50-year-old former Israeli special
   forces operative who now works privately using the pseudonym “Jorge”,
   and appears to have been working under the radar in elections in
   various countries for more than two decades.

   He is being unmasked by an international consortium of journalists.
   Hanan and his unit, which uses the codename “Team Jorge”, have been
   exposed by undercover footage and documents leaked to the Guardian.

   Hanan did not respond to detailed questions about Team Jorge’s
   activities and methods but said: “I deny any wrongdoing.”

   reality – video

   The investigation reveals extraordinary details about how
   disinformation is being weaponised by Team Jorge, which runs a private
   service offering to covertly meddle in elections without a trace. The
   group also works for corporate clients.

   Hanan told the undercover reporters that his services, which others
   describe as “black ops”, were available to intelligence agencies,
   political campaigns and private companies that wanted to secretly
   manipulate public opinion. He said they had been used across Africa,
   South and Central America, the US and Europe.

   One of Team Jorge’s key services is a sophisticated software package,
   Advanced Impact Media Solutions, or Aims. It controls a vast army of
   thousands of fake social media profiles on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook,
   Telegram, Gmail, Instagram and YouTube. Some avatars even have Amazon
   accounts with credit cards, bitcoin wallets and Airbnb accounts.

   The consortium of journalists that investigated Team Jorge includes
   reporters from 30 outlets including Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El País.
   The project, part of a wider investigation into the disinformation
   industry, has been coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a French nonprofit
   whose mission is to pursue the work of assassinated, threatened or
   jailed reporters.

About this investigative series

   Show

   The Guardian and Observer have partnered with an international
   consortium of reporters to investigate global disinformation. Our
   project, Disinfo black ops, is exposing how false information is
   deliberately spread by powerful states and private operatives who sell
   their covert services to political campaigns, companies and wealthy
   individuals. It also reveals how inconvenient truths can be erased from
   the internet by those who are rich enough to pay. The investigation is
   part of Story killers, a collaboration led by Forbidden Stories, a
   French nonprofit whose mission is to pursue the work of assassinated,
   threatened or jailed reporters.

   The eight-month investigation was inspired by the work of Gauri
   Lankesh, a 55-year-old journalist who was shot dead outside her
   Bengaluru home in 2017. Hours before she was murdered, Lankesh had been
   putting the finishing touches on an article called In the Age of False
   News, which examined how so-called lie factories online were spreading
   disinformation in India. In the final line of the article, which was
   published after her death, Lankesh wrote: “I want to salute all those
   who expose fake news. I wish there were more of them.”

   The Story killers consortium includes more than 100 journalists from 30
   media outlets including Haaretz, Le Monde, Radio France, Der Spiegel,
   Paper Trail Media, Die Zeit, TheMarker and the OCCRP. Read more about
   this project.

   The undercover footage was filmed by three reporters, who approached
   Team Jorge posing as prospective clients.

   In more than six hours of secretly recorded meetings, Hanan and his
   team spoke of how they could gather intelligence on rivals, including
   by using hacking techniques to access Gmail and Telegram accounts. They
   boasted of planting material in legitimate news outlets, which are then
   amplified by the Aims bot-management software.

   Much of their strategy appeared to revolve around disrupting or
   sabotaging rival campaigns: the team even claimed to have sent a sex
   toy delivered via Amazon to the home of a politician, with the aim of
   giving his wife the false impression he was having an affair.

   The methods and techniques described by Team Jorge raise new challenges
   for big tech platforms, which have for years struggled to prevent
   nefarious actors spreading falsehoods or breaching the security on
   their platforms. Evidence of a global private market in disinformation
   aimed at elections will also ring alarm bells for democracies around
   the world.

   The Team Jorge revelations could cause embarrassment for Israel, which
   has come under growing diplomatic pressure in recent years over its
   export of cyber-weaponry that undermines democracy and human rights.

   Hanan appears to have run at least some of his disinformation
   operations through an Israeli company, Demoman International, which is
   registered on a website run by the Israeli Ministry of Defense to
   promote defence exports. The Israeli MoD did not respond to requests
   for comment.

The undercover footage

   Given their expertise in subterfuge, it is perhaps surprising that
   Hanan and his colleagues allowed themselves to be exposed by undercover
   reporters. Journalists using conventional methods have struggled to
   shed light on the disinformation industry, which is at pains to avoid
   detection.

   The secretly filmed meetings, which took place between July and
   December 2022, therefore provide a rare window into the mechanics of
   disinformation for hire.

   Three journalists – from Radio France, Haaretz and TheMarker –
   approached Team Jorge pretending to be consultants working on behalf of
   a politically unstable African country that wanted help delaying an
   election.

   The encounters with Hanan and his colleagues took place via video calls
   and an in-person meeting in Team Jorge’s base, an unmarked office in an
   industrial park in Modi’in, 20 miles outside Tel Aviv.

   Hanan described his team as “graduates of government agencies”, with
   expertise in finance, social media and campaigns, as well as
   “psychological warfare”, operating from six offices around the world.
   Four of Hanan’s colleagues attended the meetings, including his
   brother, Zohar Hanan, who was described as the chief executive of the
   group.

   In his initial pitch to the potential clients, Hanan claimed: “We are
   now involved in one election in Africa … We have a team in Greece and a
   team in [the] Emirates … You follow the leads. [We have completed] 33
   presidential-level campaigns, 27 of which were successful.” Later, he
   said he was involved in two “major projects” in the US but claimed not
   to engage directly in US politics.

   It was not possible to verify all of Team Jorge’s claims in the
   undercover meetings, and Hanan may have been embellishing them in order
   to secure a lucrative deal with prospective clients. For example, it
   appears Hanan may have inflated his fees when discussing the cost of
   his services.

   Team Jorge told the reporters they would accept payments in a variety
   of currencies, including cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, or cash. He
   said he would charge between €6m and €15m for interference in
   elections.

The undercover footage

   Show

   What is this undercover footage?

   Disinformation operatives work under the radar. To find out more about
   'Team Jorge', an Israel-based unit selling hacking and social media
   manipulation services, three journalists went undercover. They posed as
   consultants, working on behalf of a client in a politically unstable
   African country who wanted to delay a forthcoming election. The
   reporters secretly filmed several meetings with the group's leader, Tal
   Hanan, who uses the alias 'Jorge', and his associates between July 2022
   and December 2022.

   Who is in the footage?

   The footage captures Hanan, as well as his brother, Zohar Hanan, and
   other associates of Team Jorge. Faces of reporters have been blurred.
   The meetings took place on video calls, when Hanan and his colleagues
   gave slideshow demonstrations of their services, and in person, at Team
   Jorge's office in an industrial park 20 miles outside Tel Aviv.

   Who did the secret filming?

   It was secretly filmed by three reporters from media outlets working in
   a consortium investigating disinformation: Gur Megiddo (TheMarker),
   Frédéric Métézeau (Radio France) and Omer Benjakob (Haaretz). The video
   was then shared with more than 25 other media outlets in the
   consortium, including the Guardian and Observer. While the Guardian and
   Observer were not involved in the undercover filming, they are
   publishing the material because of the strong public interest
   justifications for doing so.

   What is Team Jorge's response?

   Tal Hanan did not provide a detailed response to questions from the
   Guardian. He said: 'To be clear, I do deny any wrongdoing.'

   However, emails leaked to the Guardian show Hanan quoting more modest
   fees. One suggests that in 2015 he asked for $160,000 from the now
   defunct British consultancy Cambridge Analytica for involvement in an
   eight-week campaign in a Latin American country.

   In 2017 Hanan again pitched to work for Cambridge Analytica, this time
   in Kenya, but was rejected by the consultancy, which said
   “$400,000-$600,000 per month, and substantially more for crisis
   response” was more than its clients would pay.

   There is no evidence that either of those campaigns went ahead. Other
   leaked documents, however, reveal that when Team Jorge worked covertly
   on the Nigerian presidential race in 2015 it did so alongside Cambridge
   Analytica.

   Alexander Nix, who was the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica,
   declined to comment in detail but added: “Your purported understanding
   is disputed.”

   Team Jorge also sent Nix’s political consultancy a video showcasing an
   early iteration of the social media disinformation software it now
   markets as Aims. Hanan said in an email that the tool, which enabled
   users to create up to 5,000 bots to deliver “mass messages” and
   “propaganda”, had been used in 17 elections.

   “It’s our own developed Semi-Auto Avatar creation and network
   deployment system,” he said, adding that it could be used in any
   language and was being sold as a service, although the software could
   be bought “if the price is right”.

   Team Jorge’s bot-management software appears to have grown
   significantly by 2022, according to what Hanan told the undercover
   reporters. He said it controlled a multinational army of more than
   30,000 avatars, complete with digital backstories that stretch back
   years.

   Demonstrating the Aims interface, Hanan scrolled through dozens of
   avatars, and showed how fake profiles could be created in an instant,
   using tabs to choose nationality and gender and then matching profile
   pictures to names.

   “This is Spanish, Russian, you see Asians, Muslims. Let’s make a
   candidate together,” he told the undercover reporters, before settling
   on one image of a white woman. “Sophia Wilde, I like the name. British.
   Already she has email, date birth, everything.”

   Hanan was coy when asked where the photos for his avatars came from.
   However, the Guardian and its partners have discovered several
   instances in which images have been harvested from the social media
   accounts of real people. The photo of “Sophia Wilde”, for instance,
   appears to have been stolen from a Russian social media account
   belonging to a woman who lives in Leeds.

   The Guardian and its reporting partners tracked Aims-linked bot
   activity across the internet. It was behind fake social media
   campaigns, mostly involving commercial disputes, in about 20 countries
   including the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Senegal,
   India and the United Arab Emirates.

   This week Meta, the owner of Facebook, took down Aims-linked bots on
   its platform after reporters shared a sample of the fake accounts with
   the company. On Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson connected the Aims bots to
   others that were linked in 2019 to another, now-defunct Israeli firm
   which it banned from the platform.

   “This latest activity is an attempt by some of the same individuals to
   come back and we removed them for violating our policies,” the
   spokesperson said. “The group’s latest activity appears to have centred
   around running fake petitions on the internet or seeding fabricated
   stories in mainstream media outlets.”

   In addition to Aims, Hanan told reporters about his “blogger machine” –
   an automated system for creating websites that the Aims-controlled
   social media profiles could then use to spread fake news stories across
   the internet. “After you’ve created credibility, what do you do? Then
   you can manipulate,” he said.

‘I will show you how safe Telegram is’

   No less alarming were Hanan’s demonstrations of his team’s hacking
   capabilities, in which he showed the reporters how he could penetrate
   Telegram and Gmail accounts. In one case, he brought up on screen the
   Gmail account of a man described as the “assistant of an important guy”
   in the general election in Kenya, which was days away.

   “Today if someone has a Gmail, it means they have much more than just
   email,” Hanan said as he clicked through the target’s emails, draft
   folders, contacts and drives. He then showed how he claimed to be able
   to access accounts on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app.

   One of the Telegram accounts he claimed to penetrate belonged to a
   person in Indonesia, while the other two appeared to belong to Kenyans
   involved in the ongoing general election, and close to the then
   candidate William Ruto, who ended up winning the presidency.

   “I know in some countries they believe Telegram is safe. I will show
   you how safe it is,” he said, before showing a screen in which he
   appeared to scroll through the Telegram contacts of one Kenyan
   strategist who was working for Ruto at the time.

   Hanan then demonstrated how access to Telegram could be manipulated to
   sow mischief.

   Typing the words “hello how are you dear”, Hanan appeared to send a
   message from the Kenyan strategist’s account to one of their contacts.
   “I’m not just watching,” Hanan boasted, before explaining how
   manipulating the messaging app to send messages could be used to create
   chaos in a rival’s election campaign.

   “One of the biggest thing is to put sticks between the right people,
   you understand,” he said. “And I can write him what I think about his
   wife, or what I think about his last speech, or I can tell him that I
   promised him to be my next chief of staff, OK?”

   Hanan then showed how – once the message had been read – he could
   “delete” it to cover his tracks. But when Hanan repeated that trick,
   hacking into the Telegram account of the second close adviser to Ruto,
   he made a mistake.

   After sending an innocuous Telegram message consisting only of the
   number “11” to one of the hacking victim’s contacts, he failed to
   properly delete it.

   A reporter in the consortium was later able to track down the recipient
   of that message and was granted permission to check the person’s phone.
   The “11” message was still visible on their Telegram account, providing
   evidence that Team Jorge’s infiltration of the account was genuine.

   Hanan suggested to the undercover reporters that some of his hacking
   methods exploited vulnerabilities in the global signalling telecoms
   system, SS7, which for decades has been regarded by experts as a weak
   spot in the telecoms network.

   Google, which runs the Gmail service, declined to comment. Telegram
   said “the problem of SS7 vulnerabilities” was widely known and “not
   unique to Telegram”. They added: “Accounts on any massively popular
   social media network or messaging app can be vulnerable to hacking or
   impersonation unless users follow security recommendations and take
   proper precautions to keep their accounts secure.”

   Hanan did not respond to detailed requests for comment, claiming that
   he needed “approval” from an unspecified authority before doing so.
   However, he added: “To be clear, I deny any wrongdoing.”

   Zohar Hanan, his brother and business partner, added: “I have been
   working all my life according to the law!”
