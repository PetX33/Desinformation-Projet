EU officials warn Google and YouTube about Hamas-Israel disinformation and
graphic content

   Washington CNN  —

   The European Commission sent a warning letter Friday to Google and its
   subsidiary YouTube over disinformation and graphic content linked to
   the Hamas-Israel conflict, in the European Union’s latest effort to
   scrutinize Big Tech’s handling of the war.

   The letter from European Commissioner Thierry Breton, addressed to
   Google CEO Sundar Pichai and also sent to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan,
   reminded the company about its content moderation obligations under the
   EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA). Breton shared the letter on X.

   Breton highlighted legal requirements for Google to keep graphic
   content such as hostage videos away from underage users; to act swiftly
   when authorities flag content that violates European laws; and to
   mitigate disinformation.

   “This brings me to a second area of pressing concern: tackling
   disinformation in the context of elections, a priority which we
   personally discussed when we met in Brussels in May,” Breton wrote,
   referencing upcoming elections in a number of EU countries.

   It also warned of possible penalties if a future investigation were to
   find Google (GOOGL) is not complying with the DSA.

   Breton’s warning comes after similar letters he sent this week to X,
   the platform formerly known as Twitter, as well as Meta and TikTok.

   Unlike some of those previous letters, however, Breton’s letter to
   Google does not directly suggest the company has spread misleading or
   illegal content. And where Breton had asked some of Google’s
   counterparts to respond to his letter within 24 hours, Friday’s letter
   to Google merely requests a report “in a prompt, accurate and complete
   manner.”

   In response, YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi said the company has been
   actively working to take offensive videos down.

   “Following the devastating attacks on civilians in Israel and the
   escalating conflict in Israel and Gaza, our teams have removed
   thousands of harmful videos, and our systems continue to connect people
   with high-quality news and information,” Choi said. “Our teams are
   working around the clock to monitor for harmful footage and remain
   vigilant to take action quickly across YouTube, including videos,
   Shorts and livestreams.”

   YouTube previously told CNN its teams have removed thousands of videos
   since Hamas’ attacks on Israel began, and that it continues to monitor
   for hate speech, extremism, graphic imagery and other content that
   violates its policies.

   According to CNN’s own review of the platform, YouTube is also
   surfacing almost entirely videos from mainstream news organizations in
   searches related to the war.
