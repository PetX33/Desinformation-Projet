Beijing fosters foreign influencers to spread its propaganda

   16 comment bubble on white

They get access to both China's internet and global platforms, and cash in on
both

   China is offering foreign influencers access to its vast market in
   return for content that sings its praises and helps to spreads
   Beijing's desired narratives more widely around the world, according to
   think tank the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).

   In a policy brief [PDF] published today titled "Singing from the CCP's
   songsheet," ASPI analysts Fergus Ryan and Daria Impiombato â along
   with independent contractor on contemporary Chinese politics and media
   Matt Knight â analyzed the output of over 120 foreign influencers who
   operate active accounts on Chinese video-streaming platforms such as
   Bilibili, Douyin, Xigua, and Toutiao.

   Some, the report observes, have tens of millions of followers on
   Chinese social media, after discovering that "appealing to Chinese
   audiences' sense of nationalism can provide a fast track to gain
   popularity, increase their online presence and, ultimately, generate
   more revenue."

   "Indeed, China's internet regulations encourage users to actively
   promote party propaganda â so many influencers have adapted to thrive
   in that system," the policy brief adds.

   So far, so entrepreneurial.

   But also not possible â unless influencers are enthusiastically
   pro-Beijing.

   ASPI summarized China's strategy as follows:

   By coordinating foreign influencers and other communicators, Beijing
   aspires to create a unified choir of voices capable of promoting Party
   narratives more effectively than traditional official PRC media. The
   ultimate goal is to shield CCP-controlled culture, discourse and
   ideology from the dangers of foreign and free political speech, thereby
   safeguarding the Party's legitimacy.

   That bolstering of legitimacy happens in China and elsewhere. The
   policy brief quotes a state media worker as saying Beijing aims to
   "cultivate a group of 'foreign mouths,' 'foreign pens,' and 'foreign
   brains' who can stand up and speak for China at critical moments" at
   home and abroad.

   At home, foreign influencers are useful even when they counter Chinese
   voices: according to the policy brief, a foreigner's account was
   promoted by Beijing as it painted a rosier picture of COVID containment
   measures than posts by Chinese citizens.

   Outside the Great Firewall, the policy brief details one New Zealand
   influencer whose YouTube account has the tagline "Countering the
   Western anti-China narrative."
     * Chinese citizens feel their government is doing such a fine job
       with surveillance
     * China leads the world in tech research, could win the future, says
       think tank
     * Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia are top sources of online misinformation
     * As defense tech goes commercial, does national security miss out?

   Which is awkward, because China insists on asymmetric internet access.
   PRC citizens can only see and contribute to sites Beijing approves,
   while outsiders only get access to the Chinese internet if they're
   pro-Beijing. But China can participate freely in the global internet
   â either directly, or through proxies like influencers who know that
   backing Beijing helps contribute to livelihoods largely earned inside
   China.

   China is growing its menagerie of such influencers, and has even set up
   a studio to guide their work. ASPI asserts that Beijing is "effectively
   co-opting a widespread network of international students at Chinese
   universities, cultivating them as a talent pool of young, multilingual,
   social-media-friendly influencers." Other students are recruited
   through competitions that offer prizes for pro-China vids â sometimes
   after a Beijing-funded trip to the Middle Kingdom.

   Social media platforms try to spot this sort of stuff and restrict its
   reach. But ASPI's authors singled out X/Twitter for allowing
   verification of Beijing's tame influencers â a "step backwards" on
   Elon Muskâs watch.

   The policy brief concludes that Beijingâs efforts are "likely to have
   significant implications for the global information landscape."

   "The growing use of foreign influencers will make it increasingly
   difficult for social-media platforms, foreign governments and
   individuals to distinguish between genuine and/or factual content and
   propaganda," the document warns, which will make it harder to counter
   disinformation "and protect the integrity of public discourse."

   Over time, ASPI feels "the line between independent voices and those
   influenced by the Party's narratives may become increasingly blurred,
   further challenging the ability of audiences to discern reportage from
   manipulation."

   ASPI recommends social media platforms label Beijing-backed influencers
   and share info about them, so that rival networks can do likewise. The
   think tank also suggests educating students who intend to study abroad
   about the risks they face. Additionally, the research org wants
   governments to spend money to acquire a better understanding of
   Beijing's plan.

   "Research topics such as disinformation, information operations and
   propaganda are complicated, multi-language, data-heavy and rapidly
   evolving areas of study," the policy document notes. "Governments,
   social-media platforms and civil-society organizations that rely
   heavily on expert research groups' insights and analysis should
   consider increased support and funding for such groups." Â®
