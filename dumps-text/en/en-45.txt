   Media Among Victims in Israel-Hamas Conflict

   share


   As Israel fires back against the Hamas attack on its civilians,
   journalists and news websites have been caught in the crossfire.

   International media watchdogs have reported that several journalists
   have been killed in Gaza since Saturday, when Hamas launched its
   assault on Israel. Other reporters are injured or listed as missing.

   The militant group Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007,
   invaded southern Israel on Saturday as part of an ambush that included
   the killings and kidnappings of civilians. Israel's military said the
   death toll has surpassed 1,000.

   Israel responded to the killings and kidnappings, declaring war and
   placing Gaza and its population of 2.3 million people under siege.
   Authorities in the Palestinian territories said at least 560 people in
   Gaza have been killed.

   Journalists killed while working

   Among the media casualties is freelance photojournalist Mohammad
   Al-Salhi. News organizations say he was shot dead while covering
   military operations at the border east of the Palestinian refugee camp
   Bureij.

   The Committee to Protect Journalists also reported that journalists
   Ibrahim Mohammad Lafi of the Palestinian news agency Ain Media and
   Mohammad Jarghoun were killed while reporting in Gaza.

   "We call on all sides to remember that journalists are civilians and
   should not be targeted. Accurate reporting is critical during times of
   crisis and the media has a vital role to play in bringing news from
   Gaza and Israel to the world," CPJ's Middle East program coordinator
   Sherif Mansour said in a statement.

   Meanwhile, the International Federation of Journalists has reported
   that journalists Said al-Taweel, Mohammed Sobboh and Hisham Nawajhah
   were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit a residential building in
   Gaza City.

   "Media workers in areas of armed conflict must be treated and protected
   as civilians and allowed to perform their work without interference,"
   IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said in a statement. "There is
   intense and deeply concerned interest in this conflict all round the
   world, but people will only be able to understand what is really going

   Media organizations targeted

   Buildings housing media organizations based in the Palestinian
   territories have also been damaged in airstrikes, and in Israel, the
   English-language Jerusalem Post has been hit with cyberattacks.

   "We've been targeted by a succession of devastating cyberattacks since
   the warfare started yesterday morning," the newspaper's editor-in-chief
   Avi Mayer told the Daily Beast. "We've been trying to deal with them,
   but they've taken us down several times."

   Meanwhile, the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has
   been criticized for a surge in disinformation spread on it, according
   to the news website Wired.

   Wired identified video game footage passed off as Hamas attacks, a
   3-year-old video from the Syrian civil war made to look like it was
   taken this weekend, and images of fireworks in Algeria being shared as
   Israeli strikes on Hamas.

   Experts have said they believe the disinformation is a result of
   changes that X owner Elon Musk has made to the platform, including
   firing trust and safety staffers and an algorithm that promotes users
   who pay $8 per month for a premium subscription.

   Musk had directed followers to two sites that analysts say are known
   for sharing disinformation. The X owner later deleted those posts and
   tweeted to users that they should "try to stay as close to the truth as
   possible."
