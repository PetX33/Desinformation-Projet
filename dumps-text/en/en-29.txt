   Next week I’m giving a talk on journalism and democracy, and I thought
   I would use the newsletter this weekend to think out loud about the
   subject.

   Much of the conversation around journalism and democracy concerns the
   problems of misinformation, disinformation and partisan silos. How do
   we ensure that Americans are getting accurate information? How do we
   help people resist conspiracy theories? How do we encourage readers and
   viewers to engage with perspectives outside their own?

   I think these are important questions. But to the extent that the
   crisis in American democracy is shaped by the modern information
   environment, I don’t think the problem is misinformation,
   disinformation or partisan silos, because we’ve always had
   misinformation, disinformation and partisan silos.

   The information environment of the early American Republic — the first
   years of the Constitution, leading up to the election of 1800 — was
   saturated with conspiracies and misinformation. For all intents and
   purposes, there was no press but the partisan press well into the 19th
   century, to the extent that local political machines produced their own
   newspapers for their supporters and patrons. And conspiracies, again,
   were the common currency of American politics.
