   Next week I’m giving a talk on journalism and democracy, and I thought
   I would use the newsletter this weekend to think out loud about the
   subject.

   Much of the conversation around journalism and democracy concerns the
   problems of misinformation, disinformation and partisan silos. How do
   we ensure that Americans are getting accurate information? How do we
   help people resist conspiracy theories? How do we encourage readers and
   viewers to engage with perspectives outside their own?

   I think these are important questions. But to the extent that the
   crisis in American democracy is shaped by the modern information
   environment, I don’t think the problem is misinformation,
   disinformation or partisan silos, because we’ve always had
   misinformation, disinformation and partisan silos.

   The information environment of the early American Republic — the first
   years of the Constitution, leading up to the election of 1800 — was
   saturated with conspiracies and misinformation. For all intents and
   purposes, there was no press but the partisan press well into the 19th
   century, to the extent that local political machines produced their own
   newspapers for their supporters and patrons. And conspiracies, again,
   were the common currency of American politics.

   We tend to remember the 20th century as the age of the broad-minded and
   objective journalist, but until the Second World War, the information
   environment of American life looked much like it did in the previous
   century, with tabloids and broadsheets competing with partisan outlets
   and ideological journals.

   Our world of misinformation, disinformation and partisan news is a
   departure from the years during which a handful of large institutions
   dominated national news-making, but it’s a return to the world before
   those years, when the information environment was fractured and often
   unreliable.

   If our information has almost always been fractured and unreliable,
   then our particular information environment can’t actually explain the
   problems facing American democracy.

   In “Democracy in America,” Alexis de Tocqueville examines the role of
   the free press in American democracy. Newspapers both provide
   information for the people and are constitutive of the people
   themselves. “It would diminish [newspapers’] importance to believe that
   they serve only to guarantee freedom; they maintain civilization.”

   What Tocqueville means is that by disseminating information about the
   community and revealing the state of the community to itself, the free
   press helps constitute the groups and associations that act on that
   community and within it. “If there were no newspapers,” he writes,
   “there would almost never be common action.”

   “It often happens in democratic countries,” he continues,

     that many men who have the desire or the need to associate cannot do
     it, because all being very small and lost in the crowd, they do not
     see each other and do not know where to find each other. Up comes a
     newspaper that exposes to their view the sentiment or the idea that
     had been presented to each of them simultaneously but separately.
     All are immediately directed toward that light, and those wandering
     spirits who had long sought each other in the shadows finally meet
     each other and unite.

   A vibrant press is one of the forces that helps shape individuals into
   members of a community with responsibilities and obligations toward
   that community. It acculturates them into political life and ties them
   to other, like-minded people.

   That’s one reason that throughout American history, whenever there is a
   reform movement, there are newspapers and journalists associated with
   that reform movement, whether it’s the temperance movement or the
   abolition movement or the labor movement.

   One of the most striking aspects of the modern information environment,
   as many people have observed, is the almost total collapse of local and
   even regional news outlets. Where once every town or city of even minor
   consequence had a newspaper — with reporters who helped the community
   understand itself through their work — now there are large parts of the
   country that exist in news deserts, where there is little coverage of
   anything, from local government to local events.

   I think that this decline has played an important role in undermining
   America’s democratic institutions, as well as the public’s faith in
   democracy. It’s not just that the collapse of local news has made it
   harder to hold any number of public officials accountable —
   contributing to general cynicism about the ability of government to do
   anything constructive — but that Americans increasingly lack the
   information they need to participate in the political process in their
   communities.

   “As Americans have shifted away from local news, turnout in state and
   local elections has fallen,” notes Brookings, “and communities that
   have lost reporters have seen fewer candidates run for local office.”

   Americans have turned to national news and national news outlets to
   close the gap, but these larger institutions can’t replace what has
   been lost. By virtue of proximity, I can respond more easily when a
   local official is accused of wrongdoing. The same isn’t true of a
   member of Congress, especially if they aren’t my own. The information
   we get from national outlets is valuable, but it can also leave us
   feeling hopeless and impotent. And it can contribute to “political
   hobbyism,” a tendency to treat politics not as a cause for action and
   an essential part of citizenship, but as a game where the only goal —
   the only objective — is to somehow embarrass and humiliate our enemies.

   There has always been an element of entertainment in politics — it’s
   part of living in a mass democracy — but the total devolution of
   politics into entertainment may have something to do with the absence
   of institutions that link our political awareness to something more
   local, something more concrete, than national political conflict.

   There’s much more to say on journalism and democracy. But this, at
   least, is where my thoughts begin. I still have a few days before my
   talk; we’ll see where they go from here.

   As mentioned in a previous newsletter, I was in Hawaii for a week last
   December and took a lot of pictures while on my downtime. This is a
   snapshot from Honolulu’s Chinatown, where I wandered around for a

Now Eating: Sesame-Ginger Chicken Noodle Soup

   I was sick for much of the last week, which is why I missed the
   newsletter last Saturday, and during that time I just ate soup. Most of
   the soup was store-bought because I didn’t have the energy to make a
   new pot every few days, but I did make this riff on chicken noodle
   soup, which was excellent. A few modifications: I cooked the chicken in
   homemade chicken stock, to enhance the flavor. A store-bought, unsalted
   stock works for this as well. I seasoned the broth with fresh garlic
   and soy sauce , stirred in before serving. I also went very heavy on
   the scallions and additional ginger! Recipe comes from the Cooking
   section of The New York Times.

   Ingredients
     * 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for serving
     * 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 1½ pounds)
     * kosher salt
     * 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, sliced, plus extra julienned ginger,
       for garnish
     * ¼ cup rice cooking wine or any type of white wine
     * 12 ounces fresh ramen noodles or 8 ounces dried ramen noodles
     * 2 scallions, thinly sliced
     * ground black pepper for serving

   Directions

   Heat 2 tablespoons sesame oil in a medium pot over medium. Season
   chicken with salt and add to pot, skin-side down, along with sliced
   ginger. Cook, turning, until the chicken skin and ginger slices are
   golden, 5 to 7 minutes.

   Add rice cooking wine and boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
   Add 6 cups water and bring to a boil over high. Once boiling, partially
   cover the pot with a lid, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer
   until the chicken is tender and the broth is flavorful, about 40
   minutes.

   Remove chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl until cool enough to
   handle. Strain the broth, discarding the ginger, then season with salt,
   cover and set aside. When the chicken has cooled, discard the skin and
   bones and shred the meat then return it to the broth.

   Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of water to boil and cook ramen noodles
   according to package instructions.

   Divide cooked noodles among bowls and top with the chicken and its
   broth. Garnish with scallions, julienned ginger, a sprinkle of pepper
   and more sesame oil.
