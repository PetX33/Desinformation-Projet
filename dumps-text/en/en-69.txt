Newly declassified US intel claims Russia is laundering propaganda through
unwitting Westerners

   Washington CNN  —

   Russian intelligence is operating a systematic program to launder
   pro-Kremlin propaganda through private relationships between Russian
   operatives and unwitting US and western targets, according to newly
   declassified US intelligence.

   US intelligence agencies believe that the Russian Federal Security
   Service (FSB) is attempting to influence public policy and public
   opinion in the West by directing Russian civilians to build
   relationships with influential US and Western individuals and then
   disseminate narratives that support Kremlin objectives, obscuring the
   FSB’s role through layers of ostensibly independent actors.

   “These influence operations are designed to be deliberately small
   scale, the overall goal being US [and] Western persons presenting these
   ideas, seemingly organic,” a US official authorized to discuss the
   material told CNN. “The co-optee influence operations are built
   primarily on personal relationships … they build trust with them and
   then they can leverage that to covertly push the FSB’s agenda.”

   The campaigns have sometimes been effective at planting Russian
   narratives in the Western press, according to the intelligence. Maxim
   Grigoriev, who heads a Russian NGO, made multiple speeches to the UN
   presenting a false study that claimed the humanitarian group the White
   Helmets – which operates in Syria – was running a black market for
   human organs and had faked chemical attacks by Syrian President Bashar
   al-Assad, with whom Russia is allied. Those claims eventually found
   their way into a television report on the far-right OANN in the United
   States, according to open-source materials provided by the official.

   In a lengthy response that included photographs and details of his
   reporting in Syria, the OANN reporter said he stood by his reporting
   and stated that it was based on first-hand accounts from trips to Syria
   that were not organized by Russian agents.

   “I do not rely on any Russian sources, agencies, or informants for my
   stories,” the reporter, Pearson Sharp, wrote in an email. “I stand by
   my report on the White Helmets, and any journalist who saw what I saw
   would do the same.”

   CNN has reached out to Grigoriev.

   The official stressed that the Western voices that eventually became
   mouthpieces for Russian propaganda were almost certainly unaware of the
   role they were playing.

   “At the end of the day, this unwitting target is disseminating Russian
   influence operation, Russian propaganda to their target public,” the US
   official said. “Ultimately, a lot of these are unwitting people — they
   remain unaware who is essentially seeding these narratives.”

   The intelligence provides several examples of Russian civilian
   “co-optees” doing the bidding of the FSB.

   One man, Andrey Stepanenko, founded a media project in 2014 that
   sponsored journalists from the US and the West to visit eastern Ukraine
   and learn “the alleged truth” about what was happening in the region.
   In fact, the FSB directed his efforts and “almost certainly financed
   the project,” according to the declassified intelligence.

   CNN was not able to locate Stepanenko to ask for comment.

   The US official also cited Natalia Burlinova, the founder of a Russian
   NGO who routinely coordinated FSB-funded public diplomacy efforts aimed
   at influencing Western views. In 2018, she visited, had meetings and
   hosted events at multiple US think tanks and universities in New York,
   Boston and Washington – work that was funded by the FSB, according to
   the intelligence. Her conduct was already public: She was indicted
   earlier this year on charges of conspiring with an FSB officer to act
   as an illegal agent of Russia inside the United States, although she
   remains at liberty in Russia.

   Burlinova in an email to CNN denied that her US trips in 2018 were
   financed by the FSB.

   “All travel expenses were financed by a grant that we previously
   received from the Presidential Grants Fund, the main grant operator of
   Russia,” she said. “The FSB of Russia did not give me any money for the
   trip.”

   The official declined to offer specifics to back up the intelligence
   community’s assertions that the FSB is funding this kind of operation
   but noted that once officials were able establish FSB backing, it is
   easy to trace the narratives they are pushing in open-source materials.

   “Once you’re aware of who these people are and their association with
   the FSB, by nature of what they’re doing, they have very, very public
   personas,” the official said. “And so I would just say it’s not really
   difficult to kind of follow the strings.”

   The US official declined to say whether Russia has used these same
   tactics to try to influence US elections.

   The FSB does use similar tactics to influence political opinion within
   Russia, according to the intelligence. In one instance, a Russian media
   figure named Anton Tsvetkov organized protests outside of embassies in
   Moscow — including the US Embassy — at the FSB’s behest. The protests
   pushed Russia’s narrative of the war in Ukraine, “promoting the
   ‘Ukrainian Nazi’ narrative and blaming the U.S. and its allies for the
   deaths of children in the Donbass,” while hiding the Russian
   government’s role, according to the declassified intelligence.

   “The purpose of those protests really was … designed to sell it to the
   Russian people,” the US official said.

   This story has been updated with additional reporting.
