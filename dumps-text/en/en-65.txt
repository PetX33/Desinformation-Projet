   “Flamin’ Hot,” a movie released this month and recently screened on the
   South Lawn of the White House, is a piece of propaganda designed to
   make Mexican Americans, and Latinos more broadly, feel good about
   ourselves. There’s nothing inherently wrong with creating a film that
   seeks to make a person or a group feel good. (See: the genre of
   feel-good movies.) It can even be affirming to see yourself reflected
   in various media.

   But “Flamin’ Hot” is not only a very bad movie. It is a poor piece of
   propaganda. Wittingly or otherwise, it bolsters the white supremacy it
   purports to combat. By depicting a world in which Mexican Americans
   (and by implication all Latinos) need the approval of white people to
   feel good about ourselves, it reinforces the myth of white superiority.
   Winning, in the world of “Flamin’ Hot,” means becoming like those who
   oppress you.

   Given the gross underrepresentation of Latinos and our stories on
   bookshelves, small screens and silver screens, criticizing the movie,
   Eva Longoria’s feature directing debut, may provoke fellow Latinos to
   paint me as an anti-Latina, as a race traitor, as a pocho, slang for a
   Mexican American who’s lost his connection to his ancestry.

   I should be happy that the movie was picked up at all, they may say,
   and by Searchlight Pictures, Disney+ and Hulu, no less.
