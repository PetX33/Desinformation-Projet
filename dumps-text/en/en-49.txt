Disinformation is part and parcel of social media's business model, new
research shows

   Deceptive online content is big business. The digital advertising
   market is now worth €625 billion, and their business model is simple:
   more clicks, views or engagement means more money from advertisers.
   Incendiary, shocking content – whether it is true or not – is an easy
   way to get our attention, which means advertisers can end up funding
   fake news and hate speech.

   This is not an accident – social media platforms know they profit from
   the spread of disinformation, while advertisers turn a blind eye.

   Disinformation aims to confuse, paralyse and polarise society at large
   for political, military, or commercial purposes through orchestrated
   campaigns to strategically spread deceptive or manipulative media
   content. On social media, disinformation tools include bots, deep
   fakes, fake news and conspiracy theories.

   Up to now, most disinformation research has focused on how the system
   is abused by national interests and authoritarian leaders. My research
   shows that disinformation is, in fact, a likely and predictable outcome
   of this market system instead of an unforeseen consequence.

A business model that rewards engagement

   Social media platforms were not designed to convey information, but
   rather for entertainment. They were designed to identify things like
   the most amusing cat videos, and then recommend them to people who
   would share them. However, marketing researchers have since found that
   content that evokes strong positive emotions like awe, or negative
   emotions like anger and anxiety, is more likely to go viral. Platforms
   have taken note of this and built it into their business models.

   The business model of social media works as follows. Platforms provide
   us with free “infotainment” (information and entertainment), and do
   everything in their power to keep us engaged. While we consume the
   content, the platform harvests our data, which is then processed into
   predictive analytics – the information that is used to target adverts.
   Advertisers pay for these analytics to power their targeted advertising
   campaigns.

   There is a financial incentive for most platforms to maximise online
   engagement, which means that any content, factual or not, that receives
   clicks, likes and comments is highly valued. Influencers who share
   incendiary, controversial content can become wealthy as a result, often
   leading others to replicate their style. Therefore, it is unsurprising
   that many creators publish confrontational, simplistic and emotionally
   charged content with us-against-them narratives.

   Stoking social anxieties and fuelling tribalism is also how conspiracy
   theories circulate.

Digital marketing and disinformation

   Digital marketing is a commercial practice by which firms create value
   over the internet. It includes search optimisation, content marketing,
   influencers, pay-per-click adverts, affiliate programs, and ordinary
   advertising. Brands hire digital marketing agencies and firms known as
   ad tech, which operate the software that makes adverts follow us around
   the internet.

   ad tech firms operate without accountability or oversight, so when a
   brand pays an ad tech firm to place their ads, they also outsource
   their responsibility. A brand might therefore unknowingly end up
   funding disinformation about major global events like the
   Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine war. Even after being
   presented with evidence, brands remain silent.

   Influencers play an especially important role in this cutthroat digital
   market. Driven by the promise of advertising money they seek engagement
   at any cost, even going as far as promoting content that undermines
   democratic institutions. If an influencer has to be demonetised or
   banned for publishing hate speech it makes no difference to the
   platform, because the platforms get to keep the advertising revenue.

Democratic governance of digital platforms

   Most brands do not want to be associated with hate speech and bot
   farms, but they are. It is easy to look the other way in such a
   technically complicated market, but marketers have a responsibility.
   Brands become complicit by remaining silent.

   Policymakers and activists are pushing to reform digital platforms to
   counter disinformation. Most efforts focus on content moderation and
   fact checking, but little attention is being paid to reforming the
   digital advertising market.

   Platforms and ad tech firms must work to reform a market that profits
   from disinformation, though it appears they are often unwilling or
   unable to lead the way.

   Brand managers can use their budgets to hold platforms accountable,
   especially if they act in large numbers, as demonstrated by the recent
   X (formerly known as Twitter) ad boycott following Elon Musk’s
   antisemitic remarks. If all else fails, policymakers must step in to
   ensure that the profits of these tech giants do not come at the cost of
   our democracy.

X lawsuit accuses Media Matters of running a campaign to drive advertisers

Apple, Disney, Comcast among X advertisers pausing spending after Musk
endorsed antisemitic post

       After X owner Elon Musk amplified antisemitic conspiracy theories
       on the platform, numerous high-profile advertisers have paused
       their spending on the platform formerly known as Twitter. Per
       research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, X has failed
       to moderate hate speech on its platform that promotes antisemitic
       conspiracies, praises Hitler and dehumanizes Muslims and
       Palestinians. In a particularly egregious incident last week, Musk
       replied, "You have said the actual truth" to a post that echoed the
       same violent antisemitic conspiracy theory that was espoused by the
       killer from the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue attack.
