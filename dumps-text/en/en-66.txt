Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda

   Washington CNN  —

   A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known
   as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about
   the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found
   numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

   More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday
   addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino.

   Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic
   Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter
   said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is
   profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both
   through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda
   spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both
   Premium and regular accounts.”

   One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to
   have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing
   Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another
   report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts
   promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and
   that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100
   million times globally.

   “Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year,
   it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the
   illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps.
   Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin
   of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used
   social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.”

   X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the
   lawmakers’ accusations.

   A new report released by NewsGuard on Wednesday claimed that ads for 86
   major advertisers, including Pizza Hut, Airbnb and Microsoft, were
   shown on viral posts that pushed false or misleading claims about the
   Israel-Hamas war. The posts were seen by a total of 92 million users on
   X, according to NewsGuard.

   X released a statement in advance of the NewsGuard report’s
   publication, calling its findings into question. X could not be reached
   for further comment Wednesday evening.

   On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all
   revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in
   Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it
   was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the
   announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of
   Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s
   plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.”

   The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over
   extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by
   Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of
   high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an
   antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a
   report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that
   said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content.

   Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the
   likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some
   legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and
   “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment.

   Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of
   Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery
   counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter
   calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations
   that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own
   policies.

   It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had
   enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino
   with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6
   hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said
   it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to
   accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure
   from typical practice.”
