Kremlin’s propaganda film about Ukraine war plays to empty cinemas

   The box-office flop, about a fictional violinist who gets caught up in
   the atrocities, is further evidence that Russians want to forget about
   the invasion

   Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates

   Alexei wasn’t sure if he had entered the right cinema auditorium as he
   put down the popcorn and plunged into his chair. The room was dark and
   quiet, with only three other audience members scattered across the
   large Moscow theatre that could fit more than 100 people.

   It was a Friday evening and Alexei had come to see The Witness,
   Russia’s first feature-length film about its invasion of Ukraine that
   premiered across the country on 17 August.

   The Witness centres on a fictional character called Daniel Cohen, an
   esteemed Belgian violinist who arrives in Kyiv to perform in February
   2022, days before Russian troops entered Ukraine.

   As Russia launches its war, Cohen gets caught up in the fighting,
   witnessing a series of “inhuman crimes and bloody provocations by
   Ukrainian nationalists”, according to the movie’s premise.

   At one point, a Ukrainian commander is seen walking around with a copy
   of Mein Kampf, while other Ukrainian soldiers pledge their allegiance
   to Adolf Hitler. As a witness to these unspeakable horrors, Cohen sets
   out to tell the world the “truth” about the conflict.

   In two hours of screen time, the film covers a wide spectrum of
   falsehoods that the Kremlin has used to justify its invasion of
   Ukraine. On the eve of the invasion, Vladimir Putin said Moscow had to
   “denazify” its neighbour, the lie that Ukraine was infiltrated by
   dangerous “Nazis”.

   The release of The Witness comes on the back of plans announced by the
   Russian authorities to boost the production of movies glorifying
   Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.

   But The Witness is a box-office flop. Set to a budget of 200 million
   roubles (£1.5m), it has grossed less than 14 million roubles (£110,000)
   in its first two weeks, with viewers across the country reporting empty
   cinema halls.

   “I had seen all the other movies already and had a free evening, so
   decided just to check it out,” Alexei said, requesting that his surname
   be withheld for security reasons. “When I got to the theatre room, I
   thought the viewing [had] ended because it was so empty.”

   As the Russian authorities ramp up their war rhetoric at home, movies
   like The Witness raise questions about just how effective Russian
   propaganda films actually are.

   “Russians get force-fed propaganda everywhere they go – on state
   television, on the street, in schools and universities,” said Ivan
   Philippov, creative executive at AR Content, the production company of
   the renowned film producer Alexander Rodnyansky.

   “It is no surprise people don’t want to spend their own money to see
   more of the same,” he added.

   Opinion polls have consistently shown that many in Russia have
   preferred to turn a blind eye to the war in Ukraine. According to a
   poll published last month by the Levada Center, Russia’s only
   independent pollster, a record 40% of Russians said they do not
   actively follow the events in Ukraine, while only 23% of respondents
   said they “closely followed” the fighting.

   “Many want to see movies that allow them to forget for a moment what
   really is going on, forget about the gloom and doom of the news from
   Ukraine,” said Philippov.

   “The last thing they want is to be reminded of the war.”

   A closed Kremlin study cited last week by the Brief telegram channel
   similarly said that sociologists concluded that Russian society largely
   wished to ignore the war in Ukraine.

   Russia has a long history under Putin of pushing propaganda-style
   films. Shortly after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea, the county’s
   culture ministry financed the movie Crimea which justified the seizure
   of the peninsula. Its creators said the idea for the film came directly
   from Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister.

   Not much later, a state-sponsored romantic comedy The Crimean Bridge –
   about the Kerch Bridge, Putin’s prestige project – was written by
   Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the government-funded RT
   network. Just like The Witness, both films were box-office disasters
   and received scathing reviews from independent critics.

   “Z culture simply lacks talented people,” said the veteran culture
   critic Mikhail Kozyrev, using a popular term to refer to creatives who
   have rallied around the Russian pro-war Z symbol.

   Ever since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, hundreds of prominent
   film-makers, writers and singers have left the country, an exodus that
   has drawn parallels with the 1922 Soviet philosophers’ ships – boats
   that carried some of Russia’s leading intellectuals into exile.

   “The level and professionalism of the artists that decided to stay in
   Russia and work with the state is low,” Kozyrev said. “And the viewers
   can feel when a movie is made on orders by the state. It just isn’t
   authentic.”

   For some in the country, the pink alternate universe of Barbie has
   provided a welcome escape. While Warner Bros, the producer of the hit
   US film Barbie, pulled out of the country shortly after the war
   started, Russians have found creative ways to work around American
   copyrights laws, finding bootleg copies of the film that are then
   screened at pop-up cinemas. Some cinemas sell visitors tickets to
   little-known Russian short films and then show the pirated Barbie movie
   during the previews.

   In an attempt to discourage the Barbie craze, Russia’s culture ministry
   on Thursday said that it won’t issue special permission to pirate
   copyrights to the movie, as the film was “not in line with the goals
   set by our president to strengthen the spiritual & traditional values
   of our citizens”.
