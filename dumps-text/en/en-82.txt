Arizona superintendent reacts to high school students being allegedly taught
Hamas propaganda

   Tom Horne, Arizona's superintendent, reacted to a presentation at a
   Scottsdale Unified School District high school. He accused it of being
   Hamas propaganda.

   The Arizona superintendent of education is warning all districts in the
   state to avoid using information or collaborating with any Amnesty
   International USA and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
   education division after a high school club affiliated with the student
   wings of the organizations put on a presentation that he believed
   white-washed Palestinian terrorism.

   Jewish students were left feeling unsafe at Desert Mountain High School
   in the Scottsdale Unified School after "one-sided propaganda in favor
   spoke with FOX News Digital on background. The briefing on the
   Israeli-Palestinian conflict referred to the Second Intifada, a terror
   campaign which killed hundreds of American and Israelis in suicide
   bombings in civilian areas, as "demonstrations." The presentation, the
   parents said, also referred to Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks as
   "retaliation."

   Superintendent Tom Horne sent a letter to districts throughout the
   state that was reviewed by FOX News Digital, after he was alerted to
   the presentation. He called the presentationi "profoundly antisemitic
   in nature" as well as "anti-American," because it blamed the U.S. for
   the plight of the Palestinians.

   "If Jewish people – and Americans in general -- can be targeted by
   UNICEF and Amnesty International, who is next?" the superintendent said
   in a letter to districts around Arizona about the presentation. "The
   main thing I can do is I can warn the schools to avoid these
   them off their campuses, just as you would want to keep the Ku Klux
   Klan off your campus."

   School District.

   During the Second Intifada, there were around 138 Palestinian suicide
   attacks that killed 1,038 Israelis from 2000-2005.

   The presentation said, "Intifada 1-2… [was] largely spontaneous series
   and Palestinians refusing to work jobs in Israel, and attacks (using
   rocks, Molotov cocktails, and occasionally firearms) on Israelis."

   "A recent retaliation by Hamas left hundreds of Israelis dead, in
   response Israel has subjected Gaza to a brutal and illegal bombing
   campaign."

   The presentation further claimed that it was "Harmful language" that
   the term "'terrorist' is "dehumanizing" and often used in the media to
   describe violent Palestinian actions.

   UNICEF – an agency that received $137 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars
   in 2023 – did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   The district told FOX News Digital that the incident was "an
   a safe space" and that it was engaging in an "after-action review to
   identify… what could have been handled differently."

    "On the surface, they made most of their criticisms about Israel,"
   Superintendent Horne said. "But the kids pick up that these are Jewish
   people, and they take it out on other Jewish students. And so, if we
   allow this to go on with impressionable young people, you end up with
   the same problem that they had in the 1930s with Germany."

   When asked about the presentation framing Oct. 7 as "retaliation,"
   Amnesty International USA said it "strongly condemns Hamas' cruel and
   brutal crimes," according to a statement to FOX News Digital from the
   reprehensible attacks. Massacring civilians is a war crime, and we call
   conflict."

   Amnesty International said its other clubs have faced similar backlash.

   "We are hearing that Amnesty student chapters are facing increased
   pressure from their school administrations to not speak out on human
   rights or on topics that are viewed as ‘controversial,’" the
   Amnesty International student clubs altogether. Silencing and
   misrepresenting students in this way must stop."

   "We are in solidarity with all who want to fight for human rights
   around the world and are firmly against any kind of intimidation or
   harm faced by students working on human rights issues. We reiterate our
   commitment to building a world in which every person can enjoy the full
   range of their human rights, free from hatred and discrimination," they
   added.

   For Superintendent Horne, there are no gray areas in the framing of the
   Israel-Hamas war. It's personal for him.

   The superintendent said, "All of my extended family were killed in the
   Holocaust. So I grew up with just my parents and my sister. No
   grandparents, no nieces and nephews, no uncles or aunts. They were all
   killed. So when I see signs of antisemitism developing in the United
   States, you can imagine it's something that affects me personally."
