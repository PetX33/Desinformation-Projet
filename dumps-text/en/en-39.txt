TikTok says it has acted to curb disinformation amid Israel-Hamas war

   Moves comes after EU wrote to social media platform calling on it to
   step up its efforts over illegal content
     * Israel-Hamas war: latest news and live updates

   TikTok has said it has assigned more people to combat disinformation on
   its platform after the attack on Israel by Hamas after the European
   Union chastised the social media company.

   The company, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, said in a statement
   it had “immediately mobilised significant resources and personnel to
   help maintain the safety of our community and integrity of our
   platform”, and that it had removed more than 500,000 videos and closed
   8,000 live streams in the region.

   Social media companies have repeatedly come under scrutiny during
   periods of war, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fighting over the
   disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, and now the war between Hamas and
   Israel.

   TikTok said it had launched a command centre to look at the latest
   conflict, updated its automated detection systems to look for graphic
   and violent content, and added an unspecified number of moderators who
   speak Arabic and Hebrew. It has also restricted live broadcasts “given
   the heightened safety risk in the context of the current hostage
   situation”.

   The EU on Friday said it has opened an investigation into X, formerly
   called Twitter, over disinformation related to the conflict, while it
   also reprimanded Facebook’s owner, Meta.

   The EU’s commissioner for industry, Thierry Breton, on Thursday wrote
   to Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s chief executive, calling for the company to
   step up its efforts to respond promptly to law enforcement requests to
   take down illegal content, and asking for a response to his letter
   within 24 hours.

     #TikTok has a particular obligation to protect children & teenagers
     from violent content & terrorist propaganda —as well as death
     challenges & potentially life-threatening content.#DSA sets out very
     clear obligations TikTok must comply with.

   Breton said the EU had seen “indications that TikTok is being used to
   disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU.”

   TikTok had a particular responsibility to protect children and
   teenagers from graphic and distressing content such as videos of
   hostage taking, Breton said, and that “fake and manipulated images and
   facts” were circulating on the platform.

   The social media platform insisted it “stands against terrorism”.

   “We are shocked and appalled by the horrific acts of terror in Israel
   last week,” TikTok said. “We are also deeply saddened by the
   intensifying humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Our hearts break
   for everyone who has been affected.”

   It also said it remains “focused on supporting free expression,
   upholding our commitment to human rights, and protecting our platform
   during the Israel-Hamas war”.
