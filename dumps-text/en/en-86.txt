   Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law that
   significantly expands restrictions on activities seen as promoting LGBT
   rights in the country.

   A 2013 law banned what authorities deem to be spreading "propaganda of
   non-traditional sexual relations" to minors. The new law expands that
   ban to spreading such information to people aged 18 and older.

   The new law outlaws advertising, media and online resources, books,
   films and theater productions deemed to contain such "propaganda."

   It also broadens the existing restrictions by banning information about
   gender transitions to be spread to minors and bans information deemed
   to be propaganda promoting pedophilia.

   Violations are punishable by fines and, if committed by non-residents,
   could lead to their expulsion from Russia.

   The fines range from 100,000 to 4 million rubles. For some violations,
   foreigners could face 15 days’ detention prior to expulsion.

   The law does not make violations a criminal offense — Russian law
   stipulates that the criminal code can be amended only through an
   independent bill. Some lawmakers have suggested they favor such a
   measure.

   shown on a copy of the measure published on the website of the Duma,
   the lower house of parliament.
