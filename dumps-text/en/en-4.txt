US warns of Chinese disinformation. China says that’s disinformation

   A US State Department report that accuses the Chinese government of
   expanding disinformation efforts is “in itself disinformation,”
   Beijing’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed Saturday.

   The ministry shot back after the State Department issued a striking
   report this week in which it accused the Chinese government of
   expanding efforts to control information and to disseminate propaganda
   and disinformation that promotes “digital authoritarianism” in China
   and around the world.

   The US report, issued by the Global Engagement Center on Thursday,
   alleged that China spends billions of dollars a year on foreign
   information manipulation and warned that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had
   “significantly expanded” efforts to “shape the global information
   environment.”

   It also underlined US concerns about China as a main military
   competitor and key rival in the battle over ideas and global
   disinformation.

   US issues stark warning about China's information efforts

   Two days later, China hit back.

   “The relevant center of the US State Department which concocted the
   report is engaged in propaganda and infiltration in the name of ‘global
   engagement’ – it is a source of disinformation and the command center
   of ‘perception warfare’,” the ministry said on Saturday.

   Referring to wars in Iraq and Syria as well as US reports alleging
   human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang as examples, the ministry
   claimed that the US is “an ‘empire of lies’ through and through.”

   “No matter how the US tries to pin the label of ‘disinformation’ on
   other countries, more and more people in the world have already seen
   through the US’s ugly attempt to perpetuate its supremacy by weaving
   lies into ‘emperor’s new clothes’ and smearing others,” the ministry
   said.
