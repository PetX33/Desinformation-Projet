Chernobyl vodka a ‘strange propaganda exercise’, says victims’ charity

   The Chernobyl Spirit Company produces apple schnapps and vodka from
   fruit and grain grown in the so-called ‘Zone Two’ - HO/AFP/Getty Images

   Vodka produced in the abandoned zone at Chernobyl has been labelled a
   “propaganda exercise” by a victims’ charity.

   The Chernobyl Spirit Company, a social enterprise which creates apple
   schnapps and vodka from fruit and grain grown in the so-called “Zone
   Two”, sells the drinks to tourists and in the UK. It launched pear and
   plum versions of its schnapps in 2022.

   While previous scientific inquiries have found that the liquor does not
   contain radiation, the drinks have faced criticism from victims’
   charities for making light of the risk of radiation poisoning.

   Linda Walker, executive director at the Chernobyl Children’s Project,
   which works with people who have disabilities caused by the accident,
   said the spirit production was “inappropriate”.

   She pointed out victims of the disaster are still suffering long-term
   health effects from the fallout of the 1986 disaster.

   Ms Walker said: “It’s just such a bizarre thing to do. It’s so easy to
   grow apples, apples are grown everywhere, absolutely all over the place
   in Belarus and Ukraine.

   “To choose to grow them in the area heavily contaminated by Chernobyl,
   it’s to make a point,” adding: “It’s a very strange propaganda
   exercise.”

   Following the explosion in 1986, a 36-mile wide exclusion zone was
   created around the site’s radioactive core - Petr Shelomovskiy

   Ms Walker said health problems continue in the region, especially in
   areas where people were hunting and eating contaminated foods.

   She explained: “Especially where people were either hunting and eating
   wild boar and rabbits, or people were eating the food from the
   contaminated area.

   “That’s continued to cause all sorts of health problems in both
   children and adults.”

   It comes after some 1,500 bottles of the apple schnapps were seized by
   prosecutors in Ukraine in 2021, and were only released after a thorough
   investigation.

   It is thought the bottles were taken as a result of confusion over
   whether the right tax had been paid on the spirits.

   The company’s vodka was launched in 2019 and the drinks are made by the
   Palinochka Distillery in Ukraine before being shipped to the UK.

   The profits from the alcohol are put back into communities who were
   impacted by the 1986 nuclear disaster.

   Chernobyl Spirit’s 2022 accounts reveal that it made a profit of more
   than £10,000, after making a donation of £15,000 to the Ukrainian war
   effort.

   enterprise in 2019 - Getty Images/AFP

   Professor Jim Smith, of Portsmouth University, who started the social
   enterprise in 2019, said scientific evidence suggests the levels of
   radiation in mammals and fish in the area were not higher than in
   similar places nearby.

   He said: “You could grow apples safely and eat them, in many areas in
   this semi-abandoned area. You could grow all sorts of crops safely. The
   farmers know the crops, they know the kind of fertilisation they need
   to make crops which are below the Ukrainian limit and well below the EU
   and UK limits.”

   The professor added the Narodychi District, where the crops are grown,
   is contaminated to a “very low level”, and “no more contaminated than
   Cornwall with natural radiation”.

   He added that the area was suffering from very low investment, meaning
   there was a poor level of healthcare and a lack of jobs for the
   population that remains.

   Following the explosion in 1986, the Soviet Union created a 36-mile
   wide exclusion zone around the radioactive core.

   A new concrete sarcophagus was placed over the site in 2016, reducing
   the remaining radiation in the nearby area, but the authorities have
   struggled to decide what to do with the abandoned land.

   Ukraine is planning to build one of Europe’s largest wind farms in the
   exclusion zone, powering 800,000 homes in and around Kyiv.

Apple releases security updates for iOS, iPadOS and macOS, fixing two
actively exploited zero-days

       Apple has released security updates for iPhones, iPads and Macs to
       patch against two vulnerabilities, which the company says are being
       actively exploited to hack people. The technology giant rolled out
       new software updates, iOS and iPadOS 17.1.2, and macOS 14.1.2,
       following a vulnerability disclosure by security researchers at
       Google's Threat Analysis Group, which investigates
       government-backed cyberattacks. In the updates rolled out Thursday,
       Apple said it fixed two vulnerabilities in WebKit, the browser
       engine that powers Safari and other apps.

Meta faces more questions in Europe about child safety risks on Instagram

       Meta has received another formal request for information (RFI) from
       European Union regulators seeking more details of its response to
       child safety concerns on Instagram -- including what it's doing to
       tackle risks related to the sharing of self-generated child sexual
       abuse material (SG-CSAM) on the social network. The request is
       being made under the bloc's recently rebooted online rulebook the
       Digital Services Act (DSA), which started applying for larger
       in-scope platforms (including Instagram) in late August. The DSA
       puts obligations on Big Tech to tackle illegal content -- including
       by having measures and protections in place to prevent misuse of
       their services.

Smartphone sales to rebound on AI gains, Morgan Stanley says

       Smartphone sales will mount a comeback starting in 2024, defying
       growing warnings of a prolonged slump across the mobile sector,
       according to separate projections by Goldman Sachs and Morgan
       Stanley reviewed by TechCrunch. Morgan Stanley's report predicts
       global smartphone shipments will rebound by nearly 4% in 2024 and
       by 4.4% in 2025, shrugging off comparisons to the PC industry’s
       multi-year downdrafts. Driving the smartphone turnaround will be
       new on-device AI capabilities unlocking fresh demand, Morgan
       Stanley says.
