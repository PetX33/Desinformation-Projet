   washington —

   China is pouring billions of dollars into efforts to reshape the global
   information environment and, eventually, bend the will of multiple
   nations to Beijing's advantage, according to a new assessment from U.S.
   officials.

   The report, released Thursday by the State Department's Global
   Engagement Center, accuses the Chinese government of using a
   combination of tactics in a bid to create a world in which Beijing,
   either explicitly or implicitly, controls the flow of critical
   information.

   China's goal is to "construct an information ecosystem in which PRC
   propaganda and disinformation gain traction and become dominant," the
   report states. "Unchecked, the PRC's [People's Republic of China's]
   efforts will reshape the global information landscape, creating biases
   and gaps that could even lead nations to make decisions that
   subordinate their economic and security interests to Beijing's."

   This is not the first time U.S. officials have warned of China's
   attempts to seed the information environment to the detriment of the
   United States and its allies.

   U.S. officials said during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic
   that China was making greater use of social media to spread
   disinformation about the origins of the virus.

   Just a year later, in its annual threat assessment, the Office of the
   Director of National Intelligence said Beijing would "continue its
   whole-of-government efforts to spread China's influence … and foster
   new international norms that favor the authoritarian Chinese system."

   And U.S. officials have warned repeatedly about Chinese influence
   campaigns aimed at fostering doubts about U.S. elections, with some
   raising concerns about Chinese attempts to influence the outcomes

   But the new State Department report contends what U.S. officials are
   seeing now is different, that China's information manipulation efforts
   have matured beyond specific campaigns centered around a specific topic
   or event.

   Instead, it argues that Beijing's efforts have a grander ambition.

   If successful, "Beijing would develop a surgical capability to shape
   the information particular groups and even individuals consume," the
   report states. "In this possible future, the information available to
   publics, media, civil society, academia, and governments as they engage
   with the PRC would be distorted."

   'Another tool to keep China down'

   Chinese government officials declined to comment on details of the
   State Department report. But in an email to VOA, Chinese Embassy
   spokesperson Liu Pengyu called the report, "just another tool to keep
   China down and buttress American hegemony."

   "A quick look at its [the report's] summary is enough to know what it
   is about: heightening ideological confrontation, spreading
   disinformation, and smearing China's domestic and foreign policies,"
   Liu said. "We urge the U.S. to reflect on itself, stop framing China
   for the so-called 'information manipulation.'"

   The State Department report said its conclusions are based on publicly
   available information as well as "newly acquired government
   information."

   "As the PRC has grown more confident in its power, it appears to have
   calculated that it can more aggressively pursue its interests," it
   says.

   Specifically, the State Department report points to a multipronged
   approach combining its expansive state-run media, surveillance
   technologies, financial and political coercion and Chinese-language
   media.

   The result is an information ecosystem in which bots and trolls, and
   even officials, amplify pro-Beijing voices while drowning out or
   suppressing opponents.

   Yet the report cautions that China's considerable efforts have
   struggled, so far, to achieve the desired impact in Western and
   Western-leaning nations.

   "When targeting democratic countries, Beijing has encountered major
   setbacks, often due to pushback from local media and civil society,"
   the report states. "Although backed by unprecedented resources, the
   PRC's propaganda and censorship have, to date, yielded mixed results."

   That assessment tracks with conclusions from Meta, the social media
   company behind Facebook and Instagram, which in August announced the
   takedown of a Chinese-linked disinformation operation known as
   Spamouflage.

   Meta said that while Spamouflage was "the largest known cross-platform
   covert influence operation in the world," Beijing got little bang for
   its buck.

   "Despite the very large number of accounts and platforms it used,
   Spamouflage consistently struggled to reach beyond its own (fake) echo
   chamber," Meta said. "Only a few instances have been reported when
   Spamouflage content on Twitter and YouTube was amplified by real-world
   influencers."

   'Good wake-up call'

   Some researchers say that Beijing has made some inroads in the West.

   "China's most successful influence efforts have always been smaller in
   scale and more targeted, like the effort to harass dissidents and
   critics," Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based
   Alliance for Securing Democracy, told VOA via email.

   Schafer further described Spamouflage as a "good wake-up call."

   "It reminded the world that China is investing time and resources to
   manipulate the information environment," he said.

   And there are indications that China has become more sophisticated.

   A report earlier this month from Microsoft suggests that Chinese
   disinformation efforts successfully used artificial intelligence to
   produce "eye-catching content."

   "This relatively high-quality visual content has already drawn higher
   levels of engagement from authentic social media users," Microsoft said
   in its report. "Users have more frequently reposted these visuals,
   despite common indicators of AI-generation."

   Such use of artificial intelligence has U.S. intelligence officials
   especially concerned.

   "Russia, China, others are going to try to use this technology,"
   General Paul Nakasone told an audience at the National Press Club in
   Washington on Thursday, when asked about AI and the upcoming U.S.
   presidential election. Nakasone heads U.S. Cyber Command and the
   National Security Agency.

   Others at the NSA see China gaining ground and influence, and preparing
   to wield that influence if necessary.

   "They have growing leverage in the global social media environment,"
   said David Frederick, the NSA's assistant deputy director for China,
   during a webinar earlier this month."That could enable them to conduct
   very broad information operations at a very large scale in the case of
   conflict."
