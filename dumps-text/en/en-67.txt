   The distribution of White supremacist propaganda in 2021 reached the
   second-highest level recorded since the Anti-Defamation League began
   tracking it, the group announced on Thursday.

   Last year, there were 4,851 documented cases of racist, anti-Semitic
   and anti-LGBTQ fliers, stickers, banners and posters distributed in the
   United States, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said. That’s an average

   While hateful propaganda was reported in every state except Hawaii, the
   states of Pennsylvania, Virginia and Texas had the most reports with
   more than 300 documented incidents each, according to the report.

   The ADL began publishing its data on White supremacist propaganda
   distribution in 2016.

   'It is really dizzying for our community': Growing anti-Semitism
   forcing Jewish Americans to be more vigilant

   In its report released Thursday, the ADL noted there was an increase in
   the number of incidents involving propaganda targeting Jewish
   institutions or including overt anti-Semitic language. There were 352
   documented cases last year, compared to 277 in 2020, the ADL said.

   Those incidents included reports of stickers with the phrase “Hitler
   was right,” which were attached to a menorah outside a California
   synagogue in October.

   The ADL has said anti-Semitic incidents have continued during the first
   months of 2022 and experts and Jewish advocates said a series of
   incidents have made Jewish people more vigilant and highlighted a
   “growing crisis” in the US. Those incidents include a hostage standoff
   and reports of anti-Semitic and White separatist flyers left in
   driveways in the same Texas city, as well as flyers with anti-Semitic
   language being distributed in several other states.

   Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said
   White supremacists are resorting more frequently to hate propaganda as
   a tactic to spread their noxious ideas and recruit new membership.

   There were at least 38 White supremacist groups involved in
   distributing propaganda but the ADL attributed 91% of the activity to
   three groups – Patriot Front, the New Jersey European Heritage
   Association and Folkish Resistance Movement.

   “It’s particularly disturbing that at a time of when violent
   antisemitic assaults are on the rise, these groups are dialing-up their
   hateful rhetoric against Jews and canvassing entire communities with
   hate literature. This is an alarming trend that needs to be checked,
   now,” Greenblatt said.

   There has been an increase in domestic extremist activity in recent
   years with the use of propaganda rising to a “historic level” in 2020.

   Oren Segal, vice president of ADL’s Center on Extremism warned
   communities across the country to be prepared because hateful
   propaganda “is more coordinated than ever before” and is “often
   incubated and amplified online.”
