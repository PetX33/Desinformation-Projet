   SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea criticized rival South Korea on
   Wednesday for removing a law that banned private activists from sending
   anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets to the North, insisting that such
   activities amount to psychological warfare and threatening to respond
   with a “shower of shells.”

   The statement published by North Korea’s official Korean Central News
   Agency was the first time state media commented on the September
   decision by South Korea’s Constitutional Court to invalidate a 2020 law
   that criminalized leafleting. The decision was based on concerns that
   it excessively restricted free speech.

   The ruling came in response to a complaint filed by North Korean
   defector-activists in the South. They included Park Sang-hak, who has
   been a frequent target of the North Korean government’s anger for his
   yearslong campaign of flying leaflets across the border with giant
   balloons.

   Park and other defectors from the North for years have used huge
   helium-filled balloons to launch leaflets criticizing the leadership of
   North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un, his nuclear weapons ambitions and the
   country’s dismal human rights record. The leaflets are often packaged
   with U.S. dollar bills and USB sticks containing information about
   world news.

   North Korea is extremely sensitive about any outside attempt to
   undermine Kim’s authoritarian leadership as he maintains tight control
   over the country’s 26 million people while severely restricting their
   access to foreign news.

   The law, crafted by the previous liberal government in Seoul that
   pursued inter-Korean engagement, was passed six months after the North
   expressed its frustration over the leaflets by blowing up an
   inter-Korean liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong
   in June 2020.

   Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point years as the
   pace of both Kim’s weapons tests and the South Korea’s combined
   military exercises with the United States have intensified in a
   tit-for-tat cycle.

   In comments attributed to a political commentator, KCNA warned that the
   North would consider leafleting “high-level psychological warfare” and
   even a “preemptive attack conducted before a start of war.”

   “Under the present situation where a spark may lead to explosion, there
   is no guarantee that such military conflicts as in Europe and the
   Middle East would not break out on the Korean Peninsula,” KCNA said,
   apparently referring to Russia’s war on Ukraine and the violence in
   Israel and Gaza.

   The agency claimed that future leafleting campaigns could trigger an
   unprecedented response from North Korea’s military, which stands ready
   to “pour a shower of shells” toward the sites where the leaflets are
   launched, as well as the “bulwark of the region of (South) Korean
   puppets.”

   While North Korea often makes bizarre threats that aren’t carried out,
   the comments still reflected the animosity between the rival Koreas
   amid a prolonged freeze in diplomacy.

   The statement came hours before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
   was to arrive in Seoul for talks with allies on the growing threat
   posed by North Korea’s military nuclear program and Pyongyang’s growing
   alignment with Russia. North Korea has been supplying artillery shells
   and other munitions to Russia in recent months to fuel its war efforts
   in Ukraine, U.S. and South Korean officials have said, and they suspect
   that Kim could be seeking Russian technologies and other assistance in
   return to upgrade his own military. Both Pyongyang and Moscow have
   denied the accusations that North Korea has been providing Russia with
   munitions.

   In a separate article, the KCNA condemned the planned visits to South
   Korea by Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who
   travels to Seoul the following week, describing them as “warmongers”
   bringing a “new war cloud” to Asia.

   Blinken was in Tokyo on Tuesday taking part in the second and final day
   of the Group of 7 Foreign Minister talks, where the senior diplomats
   “strongly condemned” North Korea’s ballistic missile tests as well as
   its alleged arms transfers to Russia, which are both in violation of
   U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North, according to
   Japan’s Foreign Ministry.

   In 2022, the North blamed its COVID-19 outbreak on balloons flown from
   South Korea — a highly questionable claim that appeared to be an
   attempt to hold its rival responsible amid growing tensions over its
   nuclear weapons program.

   North Korea also fired at propaganda balloons flying toward its
   territory in 2014. South Korea then returned fire, but there were no
   casualties.

   In his latest launch on Sept. 20, Park said he flew 20 balloons
   carrying 200,000 leaflets and 1,000 USB sticks from the South Korean
   border island of Ganghwa.
