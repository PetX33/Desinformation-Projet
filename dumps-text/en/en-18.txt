“Everyone Wants Us to Pick a Side”: Reporters Grapple With Covering
Israel-Hamas War

   An inside look at how correspondents are juggling online harassment
   even as they dodge the dangers of real-time reporting in the escalating
   conflict.

   Israel-Hamas War

   Clarissa Ward was about to begin a top-of-the-hour CNN live shot in
   Sderot, Israel, when a Red Alert siren started to blare. The alert is
   “telling us to find shelter,” Ward said, as her crew hurried toward a
   bomb shelter. They didn’t make it in time. As Hamas rockets whizzed
   in the sky, Ward and her colleagues ducked in a ditch. The
   pulse-pounding scene showed that, as Ward said on air, “even with the
   most sophisticated military technology, the Israelis are still up
   against a really tough fight.”

   The world’s biggest news outlets, now in 24/7 war coverage mode, are up
   against a parallel fight against disinformation and defamation.
   Reporters say they have never seen it this bad. Ward’s compelling
   Oct. 9 live shot, which should have been a point of pride, prompted
   weeks of pain. Videos of her report were met with hateful comments
   calling her an actress. “She deserves an Oscar.” “Next time write a
   better script.” Then a click-hungry YouTube creator added an audio
   track of a faux director giving Ward stage instructions, and the
   fabricated video went viral on apps like Telegram and Elon Musk’s X,
   with titles like “CNN Busted FAKING Attack in Israel.” Musk reacted
   with a laughing-crying emoji, delighting his fans, and prodding one
   lone editor at Condé Nast to reply and say what I felt: “None of this
   is funny,” legal affairs editor Luke Zaleski wrote. “It’s tragic. X is
   a high-speed information-blender puréeing facts and news and minds into
   mush during major world events. And the effect is massive confusion
   with potentially disastrous results.”

   The past two weeks have proven Zaleski right. Confusion is the
   unfortunate byproduct of the collision between social networks and
   newsrooms. CNN publicists urged people to watch Ward’s real report “for
   themselves on a trusted platform” — meaning, not Musk’s X — and the
   meme-maker said he wasn’t trying to deceive anyone, but Ward, the
   network’s chief international correspondent, was deluged by trolls
   anyway. “My reporting has been spliced and diced, twisted and faked,”
   Ward wrote on an Instagram Story post for friends. She later turned off
   comments altogether because, she wrote, there were “one too many
   threats to kill my children and I just don’t think it helps anyone.
   Really desperate to keep the focus on the immense suffering and
   bloodshed” and the need for aid in Gaza.

   That’s how other correspondents feel, as well. “This is the absolute
   most emotionally charged story to cover,” one exasperated reporter said
   in a late night conversation. “Everyone wants us to pick a side,”
   another said. “No,” a third reporter chimed in, “everyone already
   thinks we’re on a side. They don’t believe that impartial news is
   possible.”

   In conversations with two dozen staffers at outlets like The New York
   Times, ABC and Al Jazeera, some of whom are working in the war zone, I
   heard about four overwhelming and overlapping challenges: dangerous
   conditions, factual disputes, distortions and disinformation.

   Physical dangers are paramount: Press freedom groups say that two dozen
   members of the media have died amid the fighting, mostly Palestinians.
   Mohammed Mhawish, a journalist in Gaza City, told me he harbors no
   illusions that his flak jacket labeled PRESS will provide any real
   protection from Israeli air strikes. Several of the Gazan producers who
   work for Western networks are actively trying to evacuate their
   families. At the same time, as a correspondent in Israel said, “We’re
   desperate to get into Gaza, but it’s impossible.” Reporters can hear
   blasts in the distance but can’t see the effects for themselves.

   The result: a shortage of facts. When a powerful explosion occurred
   near Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City on Oct. 17, and Hamas-aligned
   spokespeople immediately blamed an Israeli air strike, many outlets
   blasted out news alerts before it was possible to have any independent
   sourcing or reporting. Israeli officials were furious, and so were some
   journalists in the offending newsrooms. “We claim to care deeply about
   disinformation, but we’re part of the problem,” one Times staffer said
   to me, a point echoed by several others.

   Information is scarcest when public interest is greatest and the
   inverse is also, sadly, true; by the time The Wall Street Journal, The
   Associated Press and other outlets produced in-depth assessments
   pointing to a misfired rocket from Gaza as the most likely cause of the
   hospital blast, minds were made up. Masthead editors at the Times
   grappled for several days with both external criticism and internal
   concerns about the initial “Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital,
   Palestinians Say” headline, which was updated multiple times as new
   information arrived. An editor’s note on Monday said, “Times editors
   should have taken more care with the initial presentation, and been
   more explicit about what information could be verified.” (The cause of
   the hospital blast is still under investigation.)

   To the extent that the Times deserves blame for the early error, it
   also deserves credit for the note of contrition. Factual disputes will
   continue for as long as the war does. “This is a test for executives,”
   international expertise and veteran staffers who have the standing to
   say “Wait” before publishing. (“Wait” may be the single hardest word to
   say in a newsroom, but that’s why it is also the most important.) CNN
   Worldwide chairman and CEO Mark Thompson officially started his new job
   posture; so far, he is receiving high marks from staffers.

   Attention is now turning to long-term planning, which means rotating
   journalists in and out of the region. “We all need to pace ourselves
   and take care of ourselves and each other,” CBS News president Ingrid
   Ciprian-Matthews wrote in a memo, pointing out that “no one is spared
   the pain of watching so much death and destruction — whether in person

   During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, reports from news crews embedded with
   U.S. military units were likened to a “soda-straw” view of war. We’re
   now each holding whole handfuls of straws, yet unable to trust what
   we’re seeing. The number of violent videos from Israel and Gaza is
   almost limitless, capturing every conceivable angle — snuff films from
   the body-worn cameras of Hamas terrorists, silent films from Israeli
   aircraft showing bombs hitting Gaza targets, TikToks from civilians in
   the crossfire, drone videos of the aftermath. Some of the videos are
   deceptive while others, wrongly purporting to be from the war zone, are
   woven into news coverage, so that consumers know what steps are being
   taken to vet information ahead of time. MSNBC showed how to do this by
   booking Eric Carvin, the director of NBC News’ Social Newsgathering
   team, for an explainer segment on Oct. 21.

   Of course, no amount of transparency will appease the critics who are
   certain that the press is their enemy. Ward went viral again last week
   when Egyptian protester Rahma Zein confronted her at the Rafah Crossing
   between Egypt and Gaza. “You own the narrative,” she shouted. “Where
   are our voices?” Ward interviewed her and used Zein’s voice in a CNN
   report, but the thoughtful, edited package was no match for the shaky
   cellphone clips of Zein’s roar. What viewers didn’t see was that Zein
   began by invoking the made-up meme from Sderot: “You are the actress!”
