   Iran on Tuesday charged two female journalists with "propaganda against
   the state" over their coverage of mass protests.

   The judiciary announced that the journalists — Niloufar Hamedi and
   Elaheh Mohammadi — are "remanded in custody for propaganda against the
   system and conspiring against national security."

   Both women have been in custody already for more than a month.

   Anti-government protests are in their seventh week in Iran, with
   rallies breaking out across the country after the death in September of
   Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly breaching strict dress
   rules for women.

   Hamedi, who reports for the popular reformist newspaper Shargh, was
   arrested September 20, after she visited the hospital where Amini was
   taken.

   Mohammadi, a reporter for the reformist daily Ham-Mihan, was arrested
   September 29 after traveling to Amini's hometown to cover the funeral.

   Iran has responded to the protests with mass arrests. More than 2,000
   people have been charged, half of them in Tehran, according to the
   judiciary.

   As of Tuesday, more than 60 journalists had been detained, according to
   the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which is tracking arrests
   in Iran. Some of those were later released on bail, but new arrests are
   still being made into November.

   The pace of arrests has "made Iran among the world's top jailers of
   journalists in an astonishingly short time," CPJ President Jodie
   Ginsberg said in a statement. "Iranian authorities are trying to
   silence a critical moment in the country's history."

   Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to VOA's email
   requesting comment.

   'Voice of the people'

   With journalists in Iran under heightened risk, Paris-based Reporters
   Without Borders (RSF) has created a help desk in collaboration with
   Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi.

   In announcing the project, RSF said the help desk will offer digital
   support including providing virtual private networks, or VPNs, and
   helping with mirror sites to circumvent censorship, and will include a
   Farsi-language section.

   Ebadi, who in 2003 became the first female Nobel Peace laureate from
   the Islamic world, said in a RSF statement, "In this sensitive
   situation, Iranian journalists and their work in reporting what is
   going on in Iran is essential. They risk their lives to be the voice of
   the people."

   RSF Secretary General Christophe Deloire said the watchdog is providing
   media "with the tools and support needed to do their jobs as safely as
   possible" to "offer them some protection and minimize disruption to
   their work."

   Iranian journalists outside the country are also under threat over
   protest coverage.

   Police in London informed two British-Iranian journalists working for
   Volant Media of "credible threats to their lives" and those of their
   families, the station reported.

Iran Issues Death Threats to UK-Based Journalists: Broadcaster

   Volant Media is a London-based Farsi-language channel that has been
   covering the anti-government protests.

   The broadcaster said the threats against its journalists are a
   "dangerous escalation" of attempts to suppress independent media.

   The arrests and harassment of media over protest coverage is
   "unprecedented" and "we see women to be one of the primary targets,"
   Kiran Nazish, founding director of the Coalition for Women in
   Journalism (CFWIJ), told VOA recently.

   Iran's morality police, in Los Angeles, Sept. 29, 2022. As of Sept. 30,
   groups tracking arrests of journalists in Iran who covered protests set
   off by her death have documented 28 detentions. Items are shown during

   At least 17 female journalists are among those to be detained,
   according to CFWIJ.

   The grassroots organization, which focuses on the protection of women
   and LGBTQ journalists, is among the media rights groups tracking
   arrests and trying to assist those under threat.

   Iran has the third-worst media freedom record, after North Korea and
   Eritrea. The country ranks 178 out of 180 countries, where 1 has the
   best conditions for journalism on RSF's Press Freedom Index.
