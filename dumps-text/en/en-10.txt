Combating disinformation wanes at social media giants

   SAN FRANCISCO — YouTube, like other social media platforms, spent years
   expanding its efforts to tackle misinformation after the 2016 election.
   It hired policy experts and content moderators and invested in more
   technology to limit the reach of false narratives. Not anymore.

   Last month, the company, owned by Google, quietly reduced its small
   team of policy experts in charge of handling misinformation, according
   to three people with knowledge of the decision. The cuts, part of the
   reduction of 12,000 employees by Google’s parent company, Alphabet,
   left only one person in charge of misinformation policy worldwide, one
   of the people said.

   The cuts reflect a trend across the industry that threatens to undo
   many of the safeguards that social media platforms put in place in
   recent years to ban or tamp down on disinformation — like false claims
   about the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian war in Ukraine, or the
   integrity of elections around the world. Twitter, under its new owner,
   Elon Musk, has slashed its staff, while Meta, which owns Facebook,
   Instagram, and WhatsApp, has shifted its focus and resources to the
   immersive world of the metaverse.

   Faced with economic headwinds and political and legal pressure, the
   social media giants have shown signs that fighting false information
   online is no longer as high a priority, raising fears among experts who
   track the issue that it will further erode trust online.

   “I wouldn’t say the war is over, but I think we’ve lost key battles,”
   said Angelo Carusone, the president of the liberal media watchdog Media
   Matters for America. After years of efforts, he described a mounting
   sense of fatigue in the struggle. “I do think we, as a society, have
   lost the appetite to keep battling. And that means we will lose the
   war.”

   The companies maintain they remain diligent, but the efforts to combat
   false and misleading information online — which arguably peaked during
   the COVID pandemic and the 2020 presidential election — have waned at a
   time when the problem of misinformation remains as pernicious as ever
   with a proliferation of alternative sites competing for users.

   Meta restored the accounts of former President Donald Trump on Facebook
   and Instagram on Thursday, barely two years after suspending him for
   inciting violence ahead of the storming of the Capitol. It did so even
   though his posts on his own platform, Truth Social, are rife with
   extremist content, like the conspiracy theories spread by the QAnon
   movement that Facebook has previously declared unacceptable. (Trump has
   not yet posted there.)

   Musk has also invited Trump back to Twitter, one of the many steps he
   has taken to dismantle many of the platform’s previous policies,
   boasting that he wanted to undo censorious decisions made by its
   previous owners. The team that oversaw trust and safety issues —
   including misinformation — was among those eliminated under Musk’s
   leadership.

   YouTube’s staff reductions in January were not as drastic but were
   significant for the small teams assigned to set and refine the
   platform’s policies. YouTube fired two of its five misinformation
   experts, including the team’s manager, leaving behind one person for
   political misinformation and two for medical misinformation, one of the
   people with knowledge of the decision said.

   It also shed two of its five policy experts, called leads, who work on
   hate speech and harassment issues, the person said. These experts have
   played critical roles in determining where YouTube’s line between
   acceptable and unacceptable content should be and advised executives on
   difficult content decisions.

   YouTube also made small reductions among teams that enforce its
   policies and its rapid response team, which is involved in addressing
   problematic content on the platform. Outside of YouTube, Google’s trust
   and safety department shed a team of program managers who assisted
   policy experts, according to a message about the decision reviewed by
   The New York Times.

   Policy experts working on other issues like extremism, child safety,
   and policies for new products were unaffected by the layoffs.

   YouTube said that overall, the layoffs were consistent with the 6
   percent job cuts across Alphabet.

   “Responsibility remains our top priority,” Elena Hernandez, a YouTube
   spokesperson, said in a statement. “We’ll continue to support the
   teams, machine learning and policies that protect the YouTube
   community, and pursue this work with the same focus and rigor moving
   forward.”

   Still, critics are concerned that social media companies have put the
   bottom line above the public good.

   “Basically, trust and safety was the first thing to go,” said Joel
   Finkelstein co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute,
   which tracks hate and extremism on social media. “The veneer of
   civility is expensive.”

   None of the companies say they are abandoning the fight against
   misinformation. Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Meta,
   wrote after Trump’s reinstatement on Facebook that it would continue to
   intervene “where there is a clear risk of real-world harm.”

   “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying —
   the good, the bad and the ugly — so that they can make informed choices
   at the ballot box,” he wrote in a statement. “But that does not mean
   that there are no limits to what people can say on our platform.”
