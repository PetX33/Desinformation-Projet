   China's denial that it sent sonar pulses that left Australian naval
   divers with minor injuries has been labelled propaganda by the
   opposition.

Key points:

     * A Chinese warship's sonar has harmed Australian divers during a UN
       mission in the East China Sea
     * China denies the incident and has criticised Australia's reaction
       to the sonar incident
     * The opposition has dismissed China's denial as propaganda, urging a
       robust response

   HMAS Toowoomba had been operating in the East China Sea, within Japan's
   exclusive economic zone, in support of a United Nations mission to
   enforce sanctions when the incident occurred.

   Naval divers were working to clear fishing nets from the Australian
   frigate's propellers when the Chinese warship began operating its
   hull-mounted sonar.

   Defence Minister Richard Marles said the sonar was activated despite
   the Chinese ship receiving multiple warnings that the personnel were
   operating below the surface.

   "Despite acknowledging Toowoomba's communications, the Chinese vessel
   approached at a closer range. Soon after, it was detected operating its
   hull-mounted sonar in a manner that posed a risk to the safety of the
   Australian divers who were forced to exit the water," the minister said
   in a statement.

   China's defence ministry denied carrying out any activities that might
   have affected Australian diving operations: "China kept a safe distance
   from the Australian ship," a statement from its defence ministry said.

   On Monday Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking before Beijing
   denied the incident, said the Chinese vessel's use of its sonar was
   "dangerous, it was unsafe and unprofessional".

   He added the naval incident was harmful to efforts to repair relations
   between the two countries.

   "This certainly is an event that does do damage and we've made that
   very clear to China," he said.

   Mr Albanese did not say when the government raised its concerns with
   China, or to whom it made representations — a lack of detail that has
   been criticised by the opposition.

   The federal government has been on a campaign to stabilise relations
   with China following years of diplomatic relations being in a deep
   freeze and trade sanctions being imposed by China on several Australian
   exports.

Xi's diplomacy game is on show

   Just days before Xi Jinping and Anthony Albanese shook hands at the
   APEC summit, Australian divers were injured by Chinese sonar. It begs
   the question, is the on-stage diplomacy all for show?

   Since Labor's election, diplomatic communications have restarted, trade
   bans have lifted, and earlier this month Mr Albanese became the first
   prime minister since 2016 to officially visit Beijing.

   Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian, speaking to China Daily,
   labelled Australia's comments on the sonar incident as "completely
   untrue".

   Wu went on to urge Australia to "stop making reckless and irresponsible
   accusations against China" and "to create a positive atmosphere for the
   sound development of relations between the two countries and two
   militaries".

   On Tuesday, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said China's denial of the
   sonar incident was "propaganda and we shouldn't abide it for a second".

   "It's exactly what happens in relation to Japan, in relation to the
   Philippines, and in relation to other countries in the region," Mr
   Dutton said.

   "The fact is that there is aggressive behaviour taking place and our
   country should call it out."

   Clashes between Philippine and Chinese vessels have been occurring
   often in recent months, and in May last year tensions between Canberra
   and Beijing were heightened by the presence of a Chinese surveillance
   ship operating off the West Australian coast, close to a secretive
   naval communications base at Exmouth.
