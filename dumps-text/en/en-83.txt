TikTok has become a ‘propaganda machine’ for China: Sen. Tom Cotton

   Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., reacts to China and Iran’s threats to U.S.
   national security and the House’s investigation into Hunter Biden on
   ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’

   Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., says the Biden campaign should not use TikTok
   for their 2024 campaign because of the national security threats it
   poses to the U.S., pointing out that the president banned TikTok on
   U.S. government devices.

   'PR---': 'THINKS HE CAN CHEAT NATURE'

   SEN. TOM COTTON: It's not just that governors have banned it [TikTok],
   Joe Biden has banned it. We passed legislation last year that banned
   TikTok on U.S. Government devices. Yet, Joe Biden's campaign is now
   thinking, apparently, about going on to TikTok. So just think about
   that. You have all of these senior aides at the White House who carry
   two phones, one government phone on which they can't download TikTok,
   and one personal campaign phone on which they'll be obsessively
   checking TikTok to look at Joe Biden's campaign account. This has
   probably resulted, in part, from Joe Biden's polling collapse,
   especially among young voters or other core Democratic constituencies.
   That campaign is desperate to do anything, even use a Chinese
   propaganda app to try to offset Joe Biden's decline in the polls. Joe
   Biden's campaign shouldn't do it, and President Biden should sign a
   total ban of TikTok into law next month.

   PURGING APP FROM FEDERAL DEVICES: REPORT
   Would a TikTok help Team Biden? Video

   Axios first reported on Friday that Biden's team was considering using
   the platform, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, though a
   spokesman for the president's re-election downplayed the story.

   The president's talks about potentially joining TikTok come after his
   administration banned the app from being used on federal devices
   earlier this year.
