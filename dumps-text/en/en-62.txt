China’s ‘Absurd’ Covid Propaganda Stirs Rebellion

   The use of propaganda in the country has been on overdrive in the
   pandemic, with some Chinese citizens arguing the language has bordered
   on “nonsense.”

   “We have won the great battle against Covid!”

   “History will remember those who contributed!”

   “Extinguish every outbreak!”

   These are among the many battle-style slogans that Beijing has
   unleashed to rally support around its top-down, zero-tolerance
   coronavirus policies.

   China is now one of the last places on earth trying to eliminate
   Covid-19, and the Communist Party has relied heavily on propaganda to
   justify increasingly long lockdowns and burdensome testing requirements
   that can sometimes lead to three tests a week.

   The barrage of messages — online and on television, loudspeakers and
   social platforms — has become so overbearing that some citizens say it
   has drowned out their frustrations, downplayed the reality of the
   country’s tough coronavirus rules and, occasionally, bordered on the
   absurd.

   By Day 8 of a citywide lockdown in Shanghai this spring, Jason Xue had
   no more food left in his fridge. Yet when he clicked on the
   government’s social media account, he noticed that a top city official
   had vowed to “make every possible endeavor” to address food shortages.

   Government assistance didn’t show up until four weeks later, Mr. Xue
   said.

   “I was extremely angry, panicked and despairing,” said Mr. Xue, who
   works for a financial communications firm. He eventually turned to
   neighbors for help. “The propaganda was resolute and decisive, but it
   was different from the reality that we didn’t even know whether we
   could have the next meal.”
