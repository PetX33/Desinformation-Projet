The horrors of war, in truth and reportedly

   Updated October 27, 2023, 2:30 a.m.

Misinformation is an issue, but we still know that Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack was
rife with atrocity

   I was astonished by Renée Graham’s column “In the battle between Israel
   and Hamas, another potent weapon — propaganda” (Opinion, Oct. 18),
   which cited propaganda as a major issue regarding the Oct. 7 massacre
   in Israel by Hamas terrorists. While there is no question that
   misinformation across the board is a significant area of concern,
   Graham’s parsing of what was or was not a confirmed atrocity was
   insensitive and cold.

   Why has she not cited the ongoing Hamas propaganda against Israel? For
   example, when the hospital was hit in Gaza, the media were quick to
   place the blame on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces promptly released
   intelligence that strongly indicated otherwise.

   The indisputable fact remains that Hamas crossed the border into Israel
   with the intention of massacring as many Israelis as they could. They
   murdered and maimed innocent people, including the elderly, young
   adults, children, and even Holocaust survivors. They took approximately
   200 people hostage.

   Hamas has one objective: to wipe Israel off the map and to annihilate
   the Jews. Israel should retaliate. The Gazan civilians are victims of
   their own terrorist government. While Israelis certainly do not want to
   target them in any way, Gazans’ victimization by a so-called government
   that doesn’t care if they live or die, sadly, will probably lead to
   many more casualties in the name of Israeli security.

   Graham would be better served to focus on how we can prevent such a
   horror in the future rather than on whether babies were or were not
   beheaded.

Picking at the truth while the casualties mount

   At first I was encouraged when I saw the headline of Renée Graham’s
   Oct. 18 column: “In the battle between Israel and Hamas, another potent
   weapon — propaganda.” I had just read, from another news source, the
   story that the Israel Defense Forces had presented evidence that it was
   a misfired Gazan rocket that caused the Gaza hospital blast, and that
   Hamas was using this tragedy to foment further hatred against Israel.
   So I assumed this would be the topic of her column [editor’s note: the
   column was written before news reports of the hospital explosion].
   Instead she decided to blame Israel (and President Biden) for
   exaggerating Hamas’s atrocities. Does it make a difference that Hamas
   murdered babies without beheading them? Does it make a difference that
   Hamas beheaded adults and not children?
