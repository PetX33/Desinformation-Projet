   For Some Journalists, Climate Change Coverage Brings Harassment,
   Threats

   Thousands of protesters marched through New York City Sunday demanding
   that President Joe Biden and other world leaders at the United Nations
   General Assembly end the use of fossil fuels.

   As climate change has become more urgent and polarizing, the scientists
   researching it and the journalists who report on it find themselves
   harassed.

   Meteorologist Chris Gloninger says he had been excited to tie climate
   change into his weather forecasts when the CBS affiliate KCCI hired him
   in 2021.

   “I decided that I wanted the opportunity to talk about climate change
   in a part of the country where there was this massive void,” said
   Gloninger, who moved to Des Moines, Iowa, for the job. “It seemed to me
   like a no-brainer.”

   But his reporters were met with harassment and eventually some death
   threats, he said.

   “There were tons of harassing, nasty emails from other viewers that
   were cruel and filled with hate,” he told VOA.

   KCCI was supportive, Gloninger said, even assigning a security detail
   to the meteorologist. And a man was later convicted of harassment and
   fined.

   But eventually, the harassment and anxiety became too much. Gloninger
   resigned and moved to Massachusetts this year.

   Gloninger’s experience is extreme and rare, but journalists who cover
   climate change are finding themselves on the front lines of what has
   become a culture war issue.

   “Climate change for many families has joined sex, religion and politics
   at the Thanksgiving Day table as topics you don’t bring up,” said
   Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change
   Communication.

   fossil fuels in New York City, Sept. 17, 2023.

   The experiences of these reporters, climate analysts say, mark the
   confluence of several different forces: the existential threat that
   climate change poses for Earth, a decline of trust in science and the
   media, a rise in disinformation and misinformation, and a surge in
   far-right authoritarianism.

   A 2021 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found
   that while 72% of adults in the United States believe global warming is
   happening, a little over 10% do not.

   And of that small group, most also believe conspiracy theories about
   climate change.

   “They’re only 10%, but they’re a really loud 10%,” Leiserowitz told
   VOA. An even smaller percentage of that 10% are actually active in
   harassing journalists, he said, adding that he, too, has received death
   threats over his work.

   VOA spoke with seven journalists and academics focused on climate
   change, all of whom said they had experienced varying degrees of
   harassment including social media posts and aggressive emails to
   cyberstalking and hacking attempts.

   Some of that harassment came from climate change deniers or fossil fuel
   companies, and sometimes people on the left accused reporters of not
   moving fast enough or bemoaned any action as futile, the journalists
   said.

   “If you do investigative journalism in the climate space, where you’re
   looking at governments or corporations, you’re going to be upsetting
   some very powerful interests,” Neela Banerjee, a climate editor at NPR,
   said.

   Banerjee previously worked at InsideClimate News where she worked on
   the Pulitzer Prize-nominated investigation on how Exxon ignored its own
   research on the effect of fossil fuels and sought to misinform the
   public about the risks.

   When the outlet launched its series, Banerjee said, it was notified of
   attempts to hack the group’s emails. They never confirmed the
   perpetrator, she added.

   Exxon is now accused in a lawsuit alongside other oil and gas companies
   of misleading the public. The company denies any wrongdoing.

   According to Meaghan Parker, executive director of the Society of
   Environmental Journalists, “Climate journalists are just collateral
   damage of the very concerted, organized, well-funded effort to attack
   climate scientists.”

   The challenges mirror broader trends. A 2022 study by professors at
   George Washington University found that science journalists in general
   are experiencing more online harassment.

   “It’s just basically delegitimizing anyone reporting on science,” said
   Anneliese Palmer, a longtime climate journalist and research professor
   for science communication at George Washington University. “It doesn’t
   really matter what the topic is.”

   Palmer added that women who report on science often face
   disproportionately more harassment over their work, which is consistent
   with trends across the media.

   A couple decades ago, there weren’t many journalists working on the
   climate change beat, reporters who spoke with VOA said. Back then,
   climate coverage had to also cite climate change deniers — “sort of in
   a false balance narrative,” said Andrew Freedman, who covers the
   climate at Axios.

   But starting in the late 2000s, with nearly all scientists in agreement
   that climate change is real and humans are the cause, journalists were
   no longer citing pseudoscience from deniers for the sake of showing
   both sides.

   “That is when you can start to see, I think, the tide turning to
   attacking journalists,” Parker said.

   Freedman, for one, said that although he has never been targeted with
   an orchestrated harassment campaign, the threat of one “definitely
   crosses my mind on almost a daily basis.”

   “I’m not really thinking of climate contrarians whenever I sit down to
   write a story. That used to be the case, but it’s not the case
   anymore,” he added.

   Journalists are broadly grappling with the challenge of distrust in
   media being at an all-time high in the United States. But climate
   change journalists are dealing with the additional challenge that comes
   with covering a topic as polarizing as global warming.

   Other concerns include how disinformation affects audiences, and how to
   connect with those who don’t trust science in general.

   There’s so much climate disinformation out there, that Freedman, from
   Axios, said it isn’t worth trying to debunk every piece of it. “We face
   a deluge of sorting through misinformation and disinformation,” he
   said.

   Due to declining trust in media and the polarization of climate change,
   “folks who don’t accept the realities of human-driven climate change —
   both the fact that it’s human-driven, and it’s profoundly urgent — by
   and large, they’re not our audience,” NPR’s Banerjee said.

   “Piercing that information bubble that they might live in with
   misinformation, conspiracy theories — that has to be done by a trusted
   messenger,” Banerjee said.
