"Propaganda": Conservative pundit goes off on Trump's "excellent" doctor note

   Donald Trump's doctor on Monday released a glowing letter claiming that
   the former president's health is "excellent" and that he's recently
   shed a few pounds due to “an improved diet and continued daily physical
   activity," The Daily Beast reports. Dr. Bruce Aronwald, self-described
   as Trump's personal physician since 2021, said that the 77-year-old GOP
   frontrunner was "exceptional" in his cognitive exams. The doctor lists
   Sept. 13 as the day of Trump's check-up and omits specifics about his
   health, like his weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and current
   prescriptions.

   The unanticipated letter, which the former president shared on Truth
   Social, follows a batch of his verbal slip-ups, including his appearing
   to confuse Joe Biden with Barack Obama on multiple occasions this fall
   and mixing up the names of foreign leaders. He also misstated the name
   of the city he was campaigning in during a speech last month, confusing
   it with a location in another state and having the correct name
   whispered into his ear.

   Conservative commentator S.E. Cupp dismissed the letter during a CNN
   appearance, arguing that it was "no coincidence" that Trump published
   the letter on the 81st birthday of President Joe Biden, whose age and
   health have become a point of contention among both Republicans and
   Democrats. "That was propaganda. He released propaganda, right? We have
   seen no lab results,” she said, according to HuffPost. “We’ve seen
   nothing other than whatever he told this doctor to say. I also heard
   that [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un hit 11 holes in one. He says
   that so we should believe it right?” CNN's Jay Michaelson added that
   while Biden is "a little bit old," Trump is "a lying liar," and host
   Abby Phillips noted that the two 2024 presidential candidates are "not
   that far apart in age."

Meta's AI characters are now live across its U.S. apps, with support for Bing
Search and better memory

       Paris Hilton, Mr. Beast, Kendall Jenner, Tom Brady, Charli
       D’Amelio, Snoop Dog, and others, which users could chat with across
       Meta's apps. Today, the company announced its 28 AI characters are
       fully rolled out across the U.S. for people to chat with across
       WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. In addition, the company said
       more of its AI characters will support search powered by Bing and

Spade digs into credit card fraud detection intelligence following new
capital raise

       With billions of credit card transactions processed daily, there is
       opportunity for fraudulent activity, or perceived fraudulent
       activity, to slip in. Spade’s co-founders Oban MacTavish, Tess
       Bloch and Cooper Hart believe much of the fraud can be eliminated
       if card issuers have access to real-time transaction intelligence.
       When we last reported on Spade earlier this year, the company
       raised $5 million to decipher the string of numbers and letters
       that card issuers use to authorize transactions in seconds.

Millions of patient scans and health records spilling online thanks to
decades-old protocol bug

       Thousands of exposed servers are spilling the medical records and
       personal health information of millions of patients due to security
       weaknesses in a decades-old industry standard designed for storing
       and sharing medical images, researchers have warned. This standard,
       known as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, or DICOM
       for short, is the internationally recognized format for medical
       imaging. DICOM is used as the file format for CT scans and X-ray
       images to ensure interoperability between different imaging systems
       and software.

Google unveils AlphaCode 2, powered by Gemini

       Alongside its Gemini generative AI model, Google this morning took
       the wraps off of AlphaCode 2, an improved version of the
       code-generating AlphaCode introduced by Google's DeepMind lab
       roughly a year ago. AlphaCode 2 is in fact powered by Gemini, or at
       least some variant of it (Gemini Pro) fine-tuned on coding contest
       data. In a subset of programming competitions hosted on Codeforces,
       a platform for programming contests, AlphaCode 2 -- coding in
       languages spanning Python, Java, C++ and Go -- performed better
       than an estimated 85% of competitors on average, according to
       Google.

Bluesky says it will allow users to opt out of the public web interface after
backlash

       Bluesky is changing course by allowing users to opt out of a change
       that would expose their posts to the public web. Last month, the
       company announced its decentralized alternative to Twitter/X would
       soon open up a public web interface allowing anyone to view the
       posts on its platform, even if they didn't have an invite to the
       app, which remains in a closed beta. In a post on Wednesday,
       Bluesky announced its plans to open a public web interface have
       been pushed back -- a move that's likely due to the user feedback
       on the issue.

Google gives out offensive notebooks to Black summit attendees

       A source sent me a photo of a peculiar notebook received by someone
       who attended Google's K&I Black Summit in August but only recently
       looked through the merchandise from the event. On the inside of the
       notebook, however, it reads verbatim, “I was just cotton the
       moment, but I came back to take your notes.” The notebook is funny
       because it’s one of those things that, if given to a crowd of any
       other race, the slogan inside would have meant relatively nothing.
