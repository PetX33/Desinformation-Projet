"Propaganda": Conservative pundit goes off on Trump's "excellent" doctor note

   Donald Trump's doctor on Monday released a glowing letter claiming that
   the former president's health is "excellent" and that he's recently
   shed a few pounds due to “an improved diet and continued daily physical
   activity," The Daily Beast reports. Dr. Bruce Aronwald, self-described
   as Trump's personal physician since 2021, said that the 77-year-old GOP
   frontrunner was "exceptional" in his cognitive exams. The doctor lists
   Sept. 13 as the day of Trump's check-up and omits specifics about his
   health, like his weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and current
   prescriptions.

   The unanticipated letter, which the former president shared on Truth
   Social, follows a batch of his verbal slip-ups, including his appearing
   to confuse Joe Biden with Barack Obama on multiple occasions this fall
   and mixing up the names of foreign leaders. He also misstated the name
   of the city he was campaigning in during a speech last month, confusing
   it with a location in another state and having the correct name
   whispered into his ear.

   Conservative commentator S.E. Cupp dismissed the letter during a CNN
   appearance, arguing that it was "no coincidence" that Trump published
   the letter on the 81st birthday of President Joe Biden, whose age and
   health have become a point of contention among both Republicans and
   Democrats. "That was propaganda. He released propaganda, right? We have
   seen no lab results,” she said, according to HuffPost. “We’ve seen
   nothing other than whatever he told this doctor to say. I also heard
   that [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un hit 11 holes in one. He says
   that so we should believe it right?” CNN's Jay Michaelson added that
   while Biden is "a little bit old," Trump is "a lying liar," and host
   Abby Phillips noted that the two 2024 presidential candidates are "not
   that far apart in age."
