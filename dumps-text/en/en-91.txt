   Commentary
   By Peter Navarro - - Tuesday, November 21, 2023

   OPINION:

   During my four years in the White House, I witnessed President Donald
   Trump deftly negotiate with the Chinese dictator Xi Jinping on critical
   issues ranging from unfair trade and Taiwan to the slaughter of
   Americans by Made in China products and drugs. My key takeaway:
   Negotiations only serve Communist Chinese interests because the
   dictator Xi simply cannot be trusted.

   No matter what Mr. Xi has promised Joe Biden, Communist China (ChiCom)
   will continue to ship massive amounts of chemicals used by Mexican
   cartels not just to manufacture fentanyl. ChiCom factories will also
   provide the poisons needed to produce everything from cocaine and
   heroin to ecstasy and methamphetamine. Americans will continue to die
   by the tens of thousands, decimating our youth and sapping our
   workforce. This all is according to China’s unrestricted warfare plan –
   and all without Mr. Biden’s pushback.

   No matter what Mr. Xi has pledged, Communist China will likewise
   continue to flood U.S. markets with illegally subsidized products. Many
   will be manufactured with stolen intellectual property. As our trade
   deficit grows, American consumers will thereby fund the Chinese
   military while transferring exorbitant sums of American wealth and
   capital to the Communist mainland.

   No matter what assurances Mr. Xi has given, his increasingly massive
   military forces will eventually invade Taiwan. This invasion is
   inevitable without strong U.S. leadership and a combat-ready US
   military – we have neither under Mr. Biden’s rule.

   Left undiscussed at the summit were repeated ChiCom attacks on Japan,
   the Philippines, and Vietnam. The territorial waters and air spaces of
   these important American allies are now regularly invaded by China’s
   rapidly growing navy and air force – Biden simply doesn’t care.

   On the climate change front, Communist China will continue to rapidly
   swell its carbon footprint through the equally rapid construction of
   new coal-fired power plants.  Meanwhile, Xi and his advisers will laugh
   as Mr. Biden’s Green New Deal chokes our economy, neutralizes America’s
   massive advantage in oil production, and once again makes America easy
   prey for Saudi and OPEC price-gouging.

   One alleged “victory” hailed by Mr. Biden was a joint pledge to improve
   military-to-military communications. Such mil-to-mil channels will not
   stop ChiCom subs from stalking American aircraft carriers or ChiCom
   planes from harassing American aircraft in international air space.

   As for the well-known ChiCom abuses against Tibetans, Uyghurs, and
   Christians, that beat – and all of the beatings – will go on.  Support
   for human rights in Biden’s America apparently stops at the Pacific
   water’s edge.

   As I faced off with Chinese negotiators in Mar-a-Lago, Buenos Aires,
   Beijing, and Washington, this, too, became clear: Communist China’s
   strategy to conquer America without firing a shot centers on tying us
   down in endless negotiations.

   From Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan to the
   Bushes, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, the ChiComs have learned that
   if they can just keep the White House TALKING, America’s presidents
   won’t DO anything.

   That’s why Mr. Xi hated Mr. Trump.  Negotiations never stopped Mr.
   Trump from walking his tough talk; most famously, he did not hesitate
   to impose stiff tariffs when Mr. Xi refused to cease China’s unfair
   trade practices.

   That’s why Mr. Xi and his Communist cronies did everything possible to
   defeat Trump at the polls in 2020.  Whether that “everything” included
   infecting America with a deadly virus remains an open question.

   My biggest disappointment in serving this country was my failure to
   gain West Wing support for an executive order that would have gotten to
   the bottom of Communist China’s role in the pandemic. The order would
   have determined whether the release of the COVID-19 virus from the
   Wuhan lab was an accident or possibly intentional.  That order would
   also have held Communist China financially accountable for the
   trillions of dollars in damages that the virus did to the United States
   economy and our people.

   Predictably, the Wuhan bioweapons lab virus never came up at the
   Xi-Biden summit. This lacuna brings to mind the last words in my 2011
   Death By China film uttered by former Congressman Dana Rohrabacher:
   “China has been treating us like fools. And that’s because we have been
   fools.”

   Biden has been Xi Jinping’s fool since his days as Vice President. Now,
   Mr. Xi has flown home with a massive propaganda victory at a time when
   he is struggling with a sagging economy and an increasingly restive
   population.

   Finally, were you as disgusted as I by the standing ovations given to
   Mr. Xi by America’s corporate elites? Fanboys included Elon Musk, with
   his massive Tesla sweatshop in Shanghai, and Apple’s Tim Cook — 95% of
   all AirPods, iPads, iPhones, and Macs are Made in Communist China.

   Also in kowtowing attendance were Nike’s Executive Chairman and the top
   dogs at Pfizer, Qualcomm, and Mastercard. Meanwhile, two of the most
   treacherous unregistered ChiCom lobbyists during my Trump years, Black
   Rock’s Larry Fink and Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman, broke bread at the
   head table.

   We’ll see if these useful idiots of the Chinese Communist Party still
   wildly applaud after Communist China invades Taiwan and Xi confiscates
   all their factories and investment capital.
