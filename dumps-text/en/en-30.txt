E.U. Law Sets the Stage for a Clash Over Disinformation

   The law, aimed at forcing social media giants to adopt new policies to
   curb harmful content, is expected to face blowback from Elon Musk, who
   owns X.

   The Facebook page in Slovakia called Som z dediny, which means “I’m
   from the village,” trumpeted a debunked Russian claim last month that
   Ukraine’s president had secretly purchased a vacation home in Egypt
   under his mother-in-law’s name.

   A post on Telegram — later recycled on Instagram and other sites —
   suggested that a parliamentary candidate in the country’s coming
   election had died from a Covid vaccine, though he remains very much
   alive. A far-right leader posted on Facebook a photograph of refugees
   in Slovakia doctored to include an African man brandishing a machete.

   As Slovakia heads toward an election on Saturday, the country has been
   inundated with disinformation and other harmful content on social media
   sites. What is different now is a new European Union law that could
   force the world’s social media platforms to do more to fight it — or
   else face fines of up to 6 percent of a company’s revenue.

   The law, the Digital Services Act, is intended to force social media
   giants to adopt new policies and practices to address accusations that
   they routinely host — and, through their algorithms, popularize —
   corrosive content. If the measure is successful, as officials and
   experts hope, its effects could extend far beyond Europe, changing
   company policies in the United States and elsewhere.

   The law, years of painstaking bureaucracy in the making, reflects a
   growing alarm in European capitals that the unfettered flow of
   disinformation online — much of it fueled by Russia and other foreign
   adversaries — threatens to erode the democratic governance at the core
   of the European Union’s values.

   Europe’s effort sharply contrasts with the fight against disinformation
   in the United States, which has become mired in political and legal
   debates over what steps, if any, the government may take in shaping
   what the platforms allow on their sites.
