Things Are So Bad for DeSantis That His Top Propaganda Blog Is Shutting Down

   The Florida Standard has gone belly up. The death of a low-circulation
   right-wing rag would normally be fairly unremarkable, except that this
   particular publication is a favorite propaganda outfit of Florida
   governor and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis.

   According to a report from The Floridian, the Standard, which has for
   months now operated on extremely friendly, very accessible terms with
   the DeSantis campaign, has fired all of its staff and will cease
   stated that Desantis had been instrumental in propping up the flailing
   with the website’s management — even encouraging donors, lobbyists, and
   communications firms to contribute financially to publication.

   Aside from Fox News, The Standard was one of the only outlets to which
   DeSantis regularly granted interviews. A Politico review of the site’s
   content, conducted for an interview with The Standard’s Editor in Chief
   Will Witt, found that many of its articles read like press releases
   from the campaign’s PR office. It’s no surprise given that according to
   The Floridian’s investigation, DeSantis’ Rapid Response Director
   Christina Pushaw has spoken to multiple people about her contacts at
   The Standard. The site has operated as the central hub in a web of
   friendly outlets to which DeSantis’ team can feed scoops in exchange
   for positive press.

   The death of The Standard comes at a time when the DeSantis campaign
   seems to be falling apart at the seams. On Friday, DeSantis’ primary
   super PAC “Never Back Down,” fired three members of its senior
   management, including interim CEO Kristin Davison (who had only been in
   the job for nine days), Communications Director Erin Perrine, and
   Director of Operations Matthew Palmisano. The news came just a few
   weeks after reports emerged that two members of the PAC’s board had
   almost come to blows during a strategy meeting about how the campaign
   should handle the rise of fellow Republican presidential candidate
   Nikki Haley.

   For months now, concerns had been brewing within the Desantis camp that
   Never Back Down was running an ineffective strategy on behalf of their
   candidate, but the bigger, more glaring problem is DeSantis himself.

   On Thursday DeSantis was blown out of his suspiciously high heels by
   California Governor Gavin Newsom during a televised debate on Fox News.
   Much like his onstage appearances during the Republican primary
   debates, DeSantis seemed deeply uncomfortable in his own skin, and
   whatever bombshell he planned to drop against Newsom in the much-hyped
   “Red State vs. Blue State” showdown was wiped away when the California
   governor pointed out that DeSantis was down 41 points against Trump in
   his own home state.

   And it isn’t just Florida — DeSantis’ polls are floundering across the
   nation. As various single-digit candidates drop out of the Republican
   primaries, Donald Trump seems to only expand his lead against the
   field, and the odds that DeSantis manages to engineer a 180 for his
   candidacy are growing slimmer by the day.

System of intelligence — generative AI at the app layer

       Generative AI is a paradigm shift in technology, and it will spur a
       massive shift in enterprise spend over the next decade and beyond.
       Transformations of this magnitude can feel rapid on the surface,
       especially when they make a huge splash like generative AI has in
       recent months, but it’s a steep and steady climb to permeate the
       layers of the enterprise technology stack. Long before generative
       AI, enterprise applications began to deliver more consumer-like
       experiences by improving UIs and introducing interactive elements
       that would engage everyday users and accelerate workflow.
