   FakeReporter, which has been leaning on its thousands of volunteers
   scattered across the world to try to bring some clarity to the pace of
   war-related claims being made on social media.

   JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

   Since the start of the war between Hamas and Israel, images depicting
   the conflict have been all over social media. Some are real, showing
   the brutality of the war's impact on both Israelis and Palestinians.
   But there are also a lot of manipulated or misleading images and videos
   spreading online, and there are groups in many countries trying to
   fight all that disinformation. NPR's Bobby Allyn spoke to one man who
   leads an Israel-based group known as FakeReporter.

   BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Achiya Schatz walked into the kitchen and saw his
   mother-in-law standing there in tears. He was at his in-laws' house
   outside of Tel Aviv, where his family fled the violence of the war.

   ACHIYA SCHATZ: I saw the mother of my partner. She was in the kitchen,
   like, all of a sudden crying. And I ask her what happened. And she
   said, I just saw a horrible video of babies in cages of Hamas.

   ALLYN: Not only did Schatz know that it was bogus footage, the
   organization he runs, FakeReporter, was the first to show that the
   video depicted something else entirely and had been posted online well
   before the war. In the kitchen, Schatz turned to his mother-in-law and
   said...

   SCHATZ: This is a video that we refuted. It's a lie. It's fake.

   ALLYN: It's a lie, it's a fake is something Schatz's group has been
   saying a lot since Hamas attacked Israel, unleashing an information war
   online. While plenty of authentic photos and videos have portrayed the
   barbaric violence of the war, there has been an undercurrent of
   misinformation too. FakeReporter is trying to tackle it head on. Its
   more than 3,000 volunteers have access to software where images and
   videos suspected of being fake or misleading are flagged to trained
   experts who, through some internet sleuthing, figure out whether
   something is real or fake. They then report it to social media
   companies, and their reports are helping to get harmful content
   removed. Schatz is overseeing it all from what he calls a situation
   room in the front yard of his in-laws' house.

   SCHATZ: The house became like a war room for our team, for
   FakeReporter. Half my team came and we sat together, and it was also
   not just a house, a shelter, but also really, like, a situation room to
   deal with the situation.

   ALLYN: Photos from past conflicts being passed off as live footage from
   Gaza, fake orders from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
   inflammatory messages purporting to be from the Israel Defense Forces.
   Social media companies have teams dedicated to catching this kind of
   stuff, too, but Schatz says, too often, their response time is too
   slow. A video could reach millions before it's removed. Schatz says in
   the meantime, fake content is adding another layer of fog to the war.

   SCHATZ: There is a sense that you can't believe anyone. It's something
   that actually crumbles society.

   ALLYN: At first, Schatz says the day-to-day work was made more
   complicated because social media companies, especially X, formerly
   Twitter, had almost no open lines of communication after owner Elon
   Musk gutted the company's trust and safety team. And Meta, Google and
   other tech companies also reduced safety divisions. Schatz says
   recently, X and all the other platforms have gotten more responsive to
   what FakeReporter is finding. The group was founded almost three years
   ago. Before the war, it was focused on trying to help people who were
   targeted with online harassment for speaking out against corruption.
   Schatz says the social media companies were not always the best
   partners.

   SCHATZ: We don't need to wait for war to understand that people are
   under attack and are - need to be protected in the online world - on X,
   on Meta, on Google, on any platforms.

   ALLYN: Back in the kitchen, talking to his mother-in-law about the
   phony kids-in-the-cage video really made Schatz understand the
   importance of fighting against the spread of disinformation online. He
   says it's not just about separating fact from fiction, but about
   changing how people respond emotionally to a conflict.

   SCHATZ: And you can see by, for example, my mother-in-law - really
   broke her down. The same is happening to millions of people around the
   world, seeing such horrific videos online that not necessarily are
   true.

   ALLYN: And when the next fake horrific video starts spreading online,
   he says he hopes FakeReporter can stop it in its tracks before it goes
   viral. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.
