   New York CNN Business  —

   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources”
   newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.

   On Wednesday morning, as Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine entered its
   seventh day, I turned on RT, the Russia-controlled network that has in
   recent days been banned in Europe and dropped by television carriers
   across the world. Founded in 2005, RT, which operates multiple
   channels, including RT America, has served as one of Russian President
   Vladimir Putin’s largest megaphones across the world. It offers insight
   into how the Kremlin would like to portray the world and its role in
   it.

   For several hours I watched the channel and was struck by how brazenly
   its hosts and personalities worked to mislead its audience and deflect
   from the issues at hand. The main thrust of RT’s coverage presented
   Russia as a mere victim of western aggression, a country forced to
   launch a limited “military operation” after its hand was forced by a
   high-and-mighty NATO that showed no interest in taking Moscow’s
   security concerns seriously.

   Here’s a breakdown of what I observed on the network.

Russia the “liberator”

   Peter John Lavelle, the host of RT’s signature talk program,
   “Crosstalk,” put it like this: He said that the failed “liberal order”
   implemented by the West was to blame. “It is so irritating,” Lavelle
   said on his show. “The way it is being framed: Ukraine’s democracy.
   Well, it has nothing to do with Ukraine’s democracy — if you can say it
   even has one… This is about security… There is only security for other
   countries.”

   On its news programs throughout the day, RT’s on-screen graphics blared
   breaking news alerts supporting that notion: “RUSSIA: NATIONAL SECURITY
   THREATS LEFT NO CHOICE BUT TO START MILITARY OPERATION.” Another chyron
   read, “RUSSIA SAYS ITS GOALS IN UKRAINE TO DEMILITARIZE & DENAZIFY THE
   COUNTRY.”

   In fact, according to RT, Russia wasn’t even necessarily the aggressor.
   The channel at times said that Russia was a “liberator,” essentially
   freeing people from the menacing forces in Kyiv. “MILITIA SAYS 40 TOWNS
   AND VILLAGES NOW LIBERATED IN CURRENT OFFENSIVE,” a chyron declared.

   One package the network repeatedly ran characterized life under Ukraine
   as unbearable for those who lived in the Lugansk region. In another
   package, RT focused on damages to residential buildings in the Donetsk
   region.

Missing from coverage

   Noticeably left out of the coverage was a focus on how unbearable life
   has been for Ukrainians whose cities are under attack by unrelenting
   Russian forces. I did not see much coverage showing the damage that
   Russian forces have caused as they try to seize control of the country.
   Or coverage about the residents of cities such as Kyiv who live in
   terror and sleep underground in bomb shelters. Or coverage about the
   hundreds of thousands who have simply chosen to flee the country for
   their safety. Those inconvenient facts were not the emphasis of the
   narrative RT pushed.

   >> Also left out of RT’s coverage: The ramifications the West’s
   sanctions and other actions are having on Russia’s economy.

Other areas of focus

   While RT turned a blind eye to inconvenient facts, it did find time to
   portray Russians who aren’t even in the war zone as the victims. One
   segment focused on how Russians “face hostility in western countries”
   over the “situation” in Ukraine. It quoted a man in the UK who said
   that he is “not ashamed” to say he is Russian, but “afraid” and
   “worried that society will have this perception that all Russians are
   bad.”

   At other times, RT aimed to portray Russia as a country that cares
   deeply about humanitarian issues. The network aired a story on how
   Russia has welcomed school kids displaced by the war: “RUSSIAN SCHOOLS
   WELCOME HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM DONBASS.” To the backdrop of
   uplifting music, the segment featured interviews with several children
   expressing how thankful they were and saying Russia is willing to
   welcome many more kids.

Real-world consequences

   RT is being choked from public discourse now that Russia has invaded
   Ukraine and its role in promoting the Kremlin’s dishonest talking
   points has been exposed. But the outlet’s propaganda aired across the
   world unfettered for years and years, coloring the minds of untold
   numbers of people, many who distrust western news organizations. It’s a
   shame that it takes a war to get corporations to realize that the
   programming they beam into homes does matter. Russia’s real-world war
   started last week, but it’s information war started long before then.
   Imagine if these companies had acted sooner how things might be
   different.

   – The RT resignations continue: “Maria Baronova, the editor in chief of
   RT’s Russian-language edition, said she resigned from the outlet in an
   interview with news outlet Znak,” Aidan McLaughlin reports. (Mediaite)

   – “The Russian invasion is clearly making headlines globally — but how
   it is being portrayed by the media in East and West, is a different
   conversation altogether,” writes Rezwana Manjur. (Marketing)

   – Evelyn Cheng examines “how Chinese media is covering Ukraine.” She
   notes that state media has used the term “special military operations.”
