Social media disinformation spreads amid war in Israel


   By Jo Ling Kent, Kerry Breen

   October 14, 2023 / 8:33 AM EDT / CBS News



   As the [109]war in Israel and Gaza plays out in real time on social
   media, experts say bad information and propaganda are spreading on X,
   formerly [110]known as Twitter.

   Alethea, a research group, said that they had detected a network of at
   least 67 accounts on the site posting false content about the war.
   Those posts, which include mistranslated videos, have received millions
   of views.

   "It matters whether or not people believe it," said Lisa Kaplan, the
   Alethea founder, told CBS News. "The more times that people are able to
   view content of a similar nature, the more opportunities an actor has
   to convince somebody of something that may or may not be true."

   The war comes after Elon Musk, the owner of X, [111]laid off much of
   the team responsible for monitoring posts on the site. On Tuesday, the
   immediately remove "illegal content and disinformation." If not,
   "penalties can be imposed," the E.U. warned.

   X [113]said early last week that they have already removed
   "Hamas-affiliated accounts" and "several hundred accounts." Other major
   social media platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, and Snap told CBS
   News that they have increased their resources to fight disinformation.

   Mike Caulfield, a research scientist at the Center for an Informed
   Public, a multidisciplinary research center at Seattle's University of
   Washington, said that ongoing disinformation can cause chaos.

   "When we flood people with this sea of unvetted information, much of it
   deceptive, we're throwing away the goodwill of our citizens," Caulfield
   said. "We're opening the door to a variety of people that want to
   manipulate their goodwill."

   Kaplan said as the war continues, she and Alethea expect to see the
   online world "get more complicated."

   "More actors will be weaponizing information," she said.
