   China Boosts Anti-US Conspiracy Theory About Maui Fire

   “To say they [Chinese press outlets and social media users] ‘made up or
   spread disinformation’ is completely unfounded. If anyone was ‘making

   them.”
   2023
   False

   After wildfires swept across Hawaii’s Maui in August killing at least
   97 people, multiple social media posts shared a conspiracy theory
   claiming the United States military started the fires in a weather
   weapon experiment.

   A large network of pro-China influencers was behind that disinformation
   campaign, The New York Times [30]reported on September 11, citing
   reports by five different organizations.

   China's Foreign Ministry dismissed The New York Times report, with
   spokesperson Mao Ning claiming on September 18:

   “To say they [Chinese press outlets and social media users] ‘made up or
   spread disinformation’ is completely unfounded. If anyone was ‘making
   up or spreading disinformation’, it would be The New York Times, not
   them.”

   That is false.

   The New York Times article was based on investigations independently
   conducted by researchers from Microsoft, the Recorded Future
   cybersecurity company, the RAND Corporation think tank, NewsGuard
   (which rates news and information websites) and the University of
   Maryland.

   The researchers found that pro-China influencers, falsely citing the
   United Kingdom’s MI6 foreign intelligence service, orchestrated a
   disinformation campaign claiming the U.S. government started the Maui
   fires in a weather weapons experiment.

   One report, published by NewsGuard on September 11, [31]shows that in
   August and September 2023, there were at least 85 social media and blog
   accounts spreading identical posts and videos claiming MI6 had revealed
   that the U.S. government had intentionally set the Hawaiian wildfire.

   Many of the accounts involved in the campaign shared the identical
   conspiracy theory: “This Hawaiian wildfire is just a ‘weather weapon’
   attack experiment conducted by the US military!”
   The researchers indicated the claim was repeated across 14 major
   platforms, including Facebook, X, YouTube, Medium, Reddit, Pinterest
   and Tripadvisor. Almost all of these platforms are banned in China.

   Polygraph.info verified that this content started to appear on multiple
   Chinese websites on or around August 14. (Screenshots) Multiple
   bloggers on Baidu, a major blogging platform, shared similar messages
   claiming that MI6 had concluded the Maui fire was the result of a U.S.
   weather weapon experiment, not a natural disaster. The messages
   contained identical wording.

   MI6 had revealed the U.S. had intentionally set the Hawaiian wildfire.

   Later, even mainstream Chinese media like Sohu.com put out a

   A Sohu article published on August 24 asserted that MI6 had
   successfully tracked down the Maui wildfire’s mastermind after “months
   of investigation." Yet that fire broke out on August 8, only 16 days
   before the Sohu article was published. So, how could MI6 have been
   investigating it for months?

   NewsGuard reported this newly-discovered network appeared to be
   targeting users in [33]multiple countries, posting in [34]15 languages
   in addition to Chinese. The accounts also reposted and interacted with
   one another, ballooning the network‘s outreach.
   NewsGuard concluded there is “strong evidence” that Chinese speakers
   were behind the disinformation campaign, and that the first Chinese
   post spreading the claim was published at least two days before the
   first posts in other languages. Many of the accounts involved in the
   campaign only post narratives aligned with those of the Chinese
   government.

   At the time the Maui wildfire broke out, the Chinese government was
   facing [35]anger and criticism from netizens accusing it of failing to
   respond adequately to flooding that brought death and destruction to
   areas surrounding the capital Beijing.

   This is not the first time China has orchestrated a disinformation
   campaign for political gain. Earlier in September, Polygraph.info
   identified a [36]propaganda campaign involving pro-Beijing influencers
   on X, claiming the U.S. blockade against China’s tech giant Huawei had
   failed.
   In 2022, pro-China actors used X to [37]discredit Safeguard Defenders,
   a non-governmental organization that published a report about China’s
   overseas police stations.
   In September, Microsoft [38]reported that since 2022, China-aligned
   social media networks have engaged directly with authentic users on
   social media. They also are increasingly using AI-generated images in
   their social media campaigns to make them more believable.

   While the Maui wildfire is still under investigation, the reports
   fallen power poles.
