Ruling Puts Social Media at Crossroads of Disinformation and Free Speech

   The case, which could alter how the government battles disinformation,
   is a flashpoint in a broader effort by conservatives to document what
   they contend is a liberal conspiracy to silence their views.

   Reporting from Washington
   July 5, 2023

   Two months after President Biden took office, his top digital adviser
   emailed officials at Facebook urging them to do more to limit the
   spread of “vaccine hesitancy” on the social media platform.

   At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, officials held
   “weekly sync” meetings with Facebook, once emailing the company 16
   “misinformation” posts. And in the summer of 2021, the surgeon
   general’s top aide repeatedly urged Google, Facebook and Twitter to do
   more to combat disinformation.

   The examples are among dozens of interactions described in a 155-page
   ruling by a federal judge in Louisiana, who on Tuesday [14]imposed
   temporary but far-reaching limits on how members of Mr. Biden’s
   administration can engage with social media companies. The government
   appealed the ruling on Wednesday.

   The case is a flashpoint in the broader effort by conservatives to
   document what they contend is a liberal conspiracy by Democrats and
   tech company executives to silence their views. It taps into fury on
   the right about how social media companies have treated stories about
   the origins of Covid, the 2020 election and Hunter Biden, the
   president’s son.
