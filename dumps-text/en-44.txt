‘A deranged ploy’: how Republicans are fueling the disinformation wars

   Several actions by the far right in the last month could result in a
   flood of conspiracy theories before the 2024 election

   A federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that a wide range of Biden
   administration officials could not communicate with social media
   companies about content moderation issues, and in a lengthy opinion
   described the White House’s outreach to platforms as “almost dystopian”
   and reminiscent of “an Orwellian ministry of truth”.

   The ruling, which was delivered by the Trump-appointed judge Terry
   Doughty, was a significant milestone in a case that Republicans have
   pushed as proof that the Biden administration is attempting to silence
   conservative voices. It is also the latest in a wider rightwing
   campaign to weaken attempts at stopping false information and
   conspiracy theories from proliferating online, one that has included
   framing disinformation researchers and their efforts as part of a
   wide-reaching censorship regime.

   Republican attorneys general in Missouri and Louisiana have sued Biden
   administration officials, the GOP-controlled House judiciary committee
   has demanded extensive documents from researchers studying
   disinformation, and rightwing media has attacked academics and
   officials who monitor social media platforms. Many of the researchers
   involved have faced significant harassment, leading to fears of a
   chilling effect on speaking out against disinformation ahead of the
   2024 presidential election.

   The Republican pushback against anti-disinformation campaigns has
   existed for years, alleging that content moderation on major platforms
   has unfairly targeted conservative voices. Many tech platforms have
   instituted policies against misinformation or hateful speech that have
   resulted in content such as election denial, anti-vaccine falsehoods
   and far-right conspiracy theories being removed – all which tend to
   skew Republican. But research has found that allegations of
   anti-conservative bias at social media companies have little empirical
   evidence, with a 2021 New York University study showing that these
   platforms’ algorithms instead often work to amplify rightwing content.

   The rightwing narrative of tech platform censorship persisted, however,
   intensifying as companies prohibited medical misinformation about
   Covid-19. It gained additional momentum last year after the Department
   of Homeland Security rolled out a disinformation governance board aimed
   at researching ways to stop malicious online influence campaigns and
   harmful misinformation. Republican politicians and rightwing media
   immediately seized on the board as proof of a leftist authoritarian
   plot.

   Fox News hosts specifically singled out researcher Nina Jankowicz, who
   was tapped to be the board’s executive director, and ran numerous
   segments viciously mocking her. A year-long harassment campaign
   followed, leading to Jankowicz receiving death threats, having deepfake
   pornography made of her and seeing her personal information released
   online against her will.

   The disinformation governance board suspended its operations only a
   month after its debut, in what Jankowicz told the Guardian earlier this
   week was the start of a larger rightwing campaign aimed at rolling back
   checks on disinformation. “They got a win in shutting us down, so why
   would they stop there?” said Jankowicz, who was originally named in the
   Louisiana lawsuit but removed on account of no longer being a
   government official.

The GOP takes aim at researchers

   In addition to the lawsuit in Louisiana, Republicans have put pressure
   on researchers through a House select subcommittee investigation that
   launched in January and claims it will look into the “weaponization of
   the federal government”. The House judiciary committee chair, Jim
   Jordan, earlier this year issued a wide-ranging request for information
   and documents to multiple universities with programs aimed at
   researching disinformation, and has so far sent dozens of subpoenas.

   Among the institutions and officials that Jordan requested emails and
   documents from were the Stanford Internet Observatory, the University
   of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public and the non-profit
   Election Integrity Partnership. Jordan last month threatened Stanford
   University with legal action if it did not turn over additional
   records. (Stanford released communications with government officials
   but did not send some internal records, including ones that involved
   students, the university told the Washington Post.)

   The Stanford Internet Observatory, the Center for an Informed Public
   and the Election Integrity Partnership did not return requests for
   comment.

   Democratic representatives decried the committee’s activities as an
   attempt to harangue researchers and institutions that its members
   viewed as political enemies, likening it to McCarthyism and the House
   Committee on Un-American Activities.

     This committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by the Maga
     extremists who have hijacked the Republican party

   Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts

   “This committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by the Maga
   extremists who have hijacked the Republican party and now want to use
   taxpayer money to push their far-right conspiracy nonsense,” Jim
   McGovern, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts, said during
   the formation of the committee.

   The committee has struggled to be seen as legitimate, with a Washington
   Post-ABC News poll released in February showing that a majority of
   Americans view it as a partisan attempt to score political points. But
   it has nonetheless put pressure on academic institutions and emboldened
   attacks against researchers, including the University of Washington
   disinformation expert Kate Starbird, who told the Washington Post that
   she has faced political intimidation and cut back on public engagement.

   Starbird and other researchers are directly named in the Louisiana
   lawsuit for their role as advisers to a now-disbanded Cybersecurity and
   Infrastructure Security Agency subcommittee on disinformation.
   Starbird, who did not return a request for comment, has previously
   stated that the Republican-led lawsuit egregiously misrepresents her
   work.

The Louisiana lawsuit

   Republicans filed the lawsuit against Biden last year, and were joined
   by other plaintiffs that included the conspiracy site the Gateway
   Pundit and a Louisiana group opposed to vaccine mandates.

   The case was notably filed in a Louisiana district court where Judge
   Terry Doughty presides. Doughty, who was appointed by Trump and
   previously ruled against Biden administration mask and vaccine
   mandates, is a jurist Republicans specifically seek out when shopping
   for a favorable forum. He has overseen more multi-state challenges to
   the Biden administration than any other judge, Bloomberg Law reported,
   despite previously being a little-known justice based in a small city
   of less than 50,000 people.

   Legal experts questioned Doughty’s injunction against the Biden
   administration this week, the Associated Press reported, saying that
   the wide scope of the ruling meant that public health officials could
   be prevented from sharing their expertise. Meanwhile, disinformation
   researchers have stated that Republican efforts to push back against
   content moderation and safeguards against misinformation threaten to
   open the floodgates for conspiracy theories and falsehoods ahead of the
   2024 presidential election.

   Amid the rightwing campaign against content moderation and
   disinformation researchers, numerous social media platforms have also
   been peeling back restrictions. Twitter under Elon Musk, who last year
   engineered the release of some internal communications between Twitter
   and government officials, has hollowed out its content moderation
   teams. Meanwhile, YouTube has reversed a policy banning election
   denialism and Instagram allowed the prominent anti-vaccine activist
   Robert F Kennedy Jr back on the platform.

   The Biden administration stated this week that it objected to Doughty’s
   injunction in the Louisiana case, and would be considering its options.
   The justice department is seeking to appeal the ruling.
