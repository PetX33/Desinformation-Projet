2020 election disinformation targeted voters of color and 2024 will be worse,
groups say

   Community organizations are preparing for what they expect to be a
   worsening onslaught of disinformation targeting communities of color
   and immigrant communities.

   By Associated Press

   Leading up to the 2020 election, Facebook ads targeting Latino and
   Asian American voters described Joe Biden as a communist. A local
   station claimed a Black Lives Matter co-founder practiced witchcraft.
   Doctored images showed [67]dogs urinating on Donald Trump campaign
   posters.

   None of these claims was true, but they scorched through social media
   sites that advocates say have fueled election [68]misinformation in
   communities of color.

   As the [69]2024 election approaches, community organizations are
   preparing for what they expect to be a worsening onslaught of
   disinformation targeting communities of color and immigrant
   communities. They say the tailored campaigns challenge assumptions of
   what kinds of voters are susceptible to election conspiracies and
   distrust in voting systems.

   “They’re getting more complex, more sophisticated and spreading like
   wildfire,” said Sarah Shah, director of policy and community engagement
   at the advocacy group Indian American Impact, which runs the
   fact-checking site [70]Desifacts.org. “ [71]What we saw in 2020,
   unfortunately, will probably be fairly mild in comparison to what we
   will see in the months leading up to 2024.”

   A growing subset of communities of color, especially immigrants for
   whom English is not their first language, are questioning the integrity
   of U.S. voting processes and subscribing to Trump’s [72]lies of a
   stolen 2020 election, said Jenny Liu, mis/disinformation policy manager
   at the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice. Still, she said
   these communities are largely left out of conversations about
   misinformation.

   “When you think of the typical consumer of a conspiracy theory, you
   think of someone who’s older, maybe from a rural area, maybe a white
   man,” she said. “You don’t think of Chinese Americans scrolling through
   WeChat. That’s why this narrative glosses over and erases a lot of the
   disinformation harms that many communities of colors face.”

Tailoring disinformation

   In addition to general misinformation themes about voting machines and
   mail-in voting, groups are catering their messaging to communities of
   color, experts say.

   For example, immigrants from authoritarian regimes in countries like
   Venezuela or who have lived through the Chinese Cultural Revolution may
   be “more vulnerable to misinformation claiming politicians are wanting
   to [73]turn the U.S. into a Socialist state,” said Inga Trauthig, head
   of research for the Propaganda Research Lab at the Center for Media
   Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin. People from countries
   that have not recently had free and fair elections may have a
   preexisting distrust of elections and authority that may make them
   vulnerable to misinformation as well, Trauthig said.

   Disinformation efforts often hinge on topics most important to each
   community, whether that is public safety, immigration, abortion,
   education, inflation or alleged extramarital affairs, said Laura
   Zommer, co-founder of the Spanish-language fact-checking group
   Factchequeado.

   “It takes advantage of their very real fear and trauma from their
   experiences in their home countries,” Zommer said.

   Other vulnerabilities include language barriers and a lack of knowledge
   of the U.S. media landscape and how to find credible U.S. news sources,
   several misinformation experts told The Associated Press. Many
   immigrants rely on translated content for voting information, leaving
   space for bad actors to inject misinformation.

   “These tactics exploit information vacuums when there’s a lot of
   uncertainty around how these processes work, especially because a lot
   of election materials may not be translated in the languages our
   communities speak or be available in forms they are likely to access,”
   said Clara Jiménez Cruz, another co-founder of Factchequeado.

   Misinformation can also arise from mistranslations. The Brookings
   Institute, a nonprofit think tank, [74]found examples of
   mistranslations in Colombian, Cuban and Venezuelan WhatsApp groups,
   where “progressive” was translated to “progresista,” which carries
   “far-left connotations that are closer to the Spanish words
   ‘socialista’ and ‘comunista.’”

How disinformation spreads

   Disinformation, often in languages like Spanish, Mandarin or Hindi,
   flows onto social media apps like WhatsApp and WeChat heavily used by
   communities of color.

   Minority communities that believe their views and perspectives aren’t
   represented by the mainstream are likely to “retreat into more private
   spaces” found on messaging apps or groups on social media sites like
   Facebook, Trauthig said.

   “But disinformation also targets them on these platforms, even though
   it may feel to them to be that safer space,” she said.

   Messages on WhatsApp are also encrypted and can’t be easily seen or
   traced by moderators or fact-checkers.

   “As a result, messages on apps like WhatsApp often fly under the radar
   and are allowed to spread and spread, largely unchecked,” said Randy
   Abreu, policy counsel for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, which
   leads the Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition.

   Abreu also raised concerns about Spanish YouTube channels and radio
   shows that are growing in popularity. He said the coalition is tracking
   more and more YouTube and radio personalities who are [75]spreading
   misinformation in Spanish.

   tracked 40 Spanish-language YouTube videos spreading misinformation
   about U.S. elections. Many of these videos remained on the platform,
   despite violating YouTube election misinformation policy, the report
   said.

Disinformation — and disenfranchisement

   Amid [77]changes in voting policies at state and local levels,
   advocates are sounding the alarm on how disinformation about voting in
   2024 may target communities of color. Many of these efforts have surged
   as Asian American, Black and Latino communities have grown in political
   power, said María Teresa Kumar, founding president of the nonprofit
   advocacy group Voto Latino.

   “Disinformation is, at its core, meant to be a sort of voter
   suppression tactic for communities of color,” she said. “It targets
   communities of color in a way that feeds into their already justifiable
   concerns that the system is stacked against them.”
   María Teresa Kumar, María Teresa Kumar, founding president of the
   nonprofit advocacy group Voto Latino, delivers opening remarks at a
   summit in 2019, in Austin, Texas. AP

   The tactics also feed into a history “as old as the Jim Crow era of
   attempting to disenfranchise people of color, going back to voter
   intimidation and suppression efforts after the Civil Rights Act of
   1866,” said Atiba Ellis, a professor of law at Case Western Reserve
   University School of Law.

   While many of the same recycled claims around alleged fraud in the 2020
   and 2022 elections are expected to resurface, experts say
   disinformation campaigns will likely be more sophisticated and granular
   in attempts to target specific groups of voters of color.

   Trauthig also raised concerns about how layoffs and instability at
   social media platforms like Twitter may leave them less prepared to
   tackle misinformation in 2024. It also remains to be seen how [78]new
   social media platforms like Threads will approach the threat of
   misinformation. Changes in policies like WhatsApp launching a
   “Communities” function connecting multiple groups and expanding group
   chat sizes may also “have big implications for how quickly
   misinformation will spread on the platform,” she said.

   In response to the mounting threat of misinformation, Indian American
   Impact is ramping up its fact-checking efforts through what the
   organization says is the first fact-checking website specifically for
   South Asian Americans. Shah said the group is drawing inspiration from
   2022 projects, including a voting toolkit using memes with Bollywood
   characters and passing out Parle-G crackers with voting information
   stickers at Indian grocery stores.

   Cruz of Factchequeado is paying close attention to misinformation in
   swing states with significant Latino populations like Nevada and
   Arizona. And Liu of Asian Americans Advancing Justice is reviewing
   misinformation trends from previous elections to strategize about how
   to inoculate Asian American voters against them.

   Still, they say there is more work to be done.

   Critics are urging social media companies to invest in content
   moderation and fact-checking in languages other than English.
   Government and election officials should also make voting information
   more accessible to non-English speakers, organize media literacy
   trainings in community spaces and identify “trusted messengers” in
   communities of color to help approach trends in misinformation
   narratives, experts said.

   “These are not monolithic groups,” Cruz said. “This disinformation is
   very specifically tailored to each of these communities and their
   fears. So we also need to be partnering with grassroots organizations
   in each of these communities to tailor our approaches. If we don’t take
   the time to do this work, our democracy is at stake.”
