Chernobyl vodka a ‘strange propaganda exercise’, says victims’ charity

   The Chernobyl Spirit Company produces apple schnapps and vodka from
   fruit and grain grown in the so-called ‘Zone Two’ - HO/AFP/Getty Images

   Vodka produced in the abandoned zone at Chernobyl has been labelled a
   “propaganda exercise” by a victims’ charity.

   The Chernobyl Spirit Company, a social enterprise which creates apple
   schnapps and vodka from fruit and grain grown in the so-called “Zone
   Two”, sells the drinks to tourists and in the UK. It launched pear and
   plum versions of its schnapps in 2022.

   While previous scientific inquiries have found that the liquor does not
   contain radiation, the drinks have faced criticism from victims’
   charities for making light of the risk of radiation poisoning.

   Linda Walker, executive director at the Chernobyl Children’s Project,
   which works with people who have disabilities caused by the accident,
   said the spirit production was “inappropriate”.

   She pointed out victims of the disaster are still suffering long-term
   health effects from the fallout of the 1986 disaster.

   Ms Walker said: “It’s just such a bizarre thing to do. It’s so easy to
   grow apples, apples are grown everywhere, absolutely all over the place
   in Belarus and Ukraine.

   “To choose to grow them in the area heavily contaminated by Chernobyl,
   it’s to make a point,” adding: “It’s a very strange propaganda
   exercise.”

   Following the explosion in 1986, a 36-mile wide exclusion zone was
   created around the site’s radioactive core - Petr Shelomovskiy

   Ms Walker said health problems continue in the region, especially in
   areas where people were hunting and eating contaminated foods.

   She explained: “Especially where people were either hunting and eating
   wild boar and rabbits, or people were eating the food from the
   contaminated area.

   “That’s continued to cause all sorts of health problems in both
   children and adults.”

   It comes after some 1,500 bottles of the apple schnapps were seized by
   prosecutors in Ukraine in 2021, and were only released after a thorough
   investigation.

   It is thought the bottles were taken as a result of confusion over
   whether the right tax had been paid on the spirits.

   The company’s vodka was launched in 2019 and the drinks are made by the
   Palinochka Distillery in Ukraine before being shipped to the UK.

   The profits from the alcohol are put back into communities who were
   impacted by the 1986 nuclear disaster.

   Chernobyl Spirit’s 2022 accounts reveal that it made a profit of more
   than £10,000, after making a donation of £15,000 to the Ukrainian war
   effort.

   enterprise in 2019 - Getty Images/AFP

   Professor Jim Smith, of Portsmouth University, who started the social
   enterprise in 2019, said scientific evidence suggests the levels of
   radiation in mammals and fish in the area were not higher than in
   similar places nearby.

   He said: “You could grow apples safely and eat them, in many areas in
   this semi-abandoned area. You could grow all sorts of crops safely. The
   farmers know the crops, they know the kind of fertilisation they need
   to make crops which are below the Ukrainian limit and well below the EU
   and UK limits.”

   The professor added the Narodychi District, where the crops are grown,
   is contaminated to a “very low level”, and “no more contaminated than
   Cornwall with natural radiation”.

   He added that the area was suffering from very low investment, meaning
   there was a poor level of healthcare and a lack of jobs for the
   population that remains.

   Following the explosion in 1986, the Soviet Union created a 36-mile
   wide exclusion zone around the radioactive core.

   A new concrete sarcophagus was placed over the site in 2016, reducing
   the remaining radiation in the nearby area, but the authorities have
   struggled to decide what to do with the abandoned land.

   Ukraine is planning to build one of Europe’s largest wind farms in the
   exclusion zone, powering 800,000 homes in and around Kyiv.
