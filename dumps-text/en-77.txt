   SEOUL, South Korea —

   South Korea's constitutional court ruled on Tuesday the ban on sending
   propaganda leaflets to North Korea was unconstitutional, striking down
   a law passed in 2020 by the liberal party of then-President Moon
   Jae-in, who sought better ties with Pyongyang.

   The law, which subjects violators to up to three years in prison or
   $22,210 in fines, had come under intense criticism from rights
   activists and conservative lawmakers as a violation of free speech
   rights.

   The 7-2 found that a clause in the Development of Inter-Korean
   Relations Act banning the distribution of leaflets excessively limited
   freedom of speech, the Court said in a summary of the ruling.

   The clause characterized the sending of leaflets as a potential cause
   of danger and serious harm to South Korean citizens, especially those
   who live near the border in the event North Korea retaliated by force.

   The court's decision to nullify the law takes effect immediately.

   Groups run by North Korean defectors and other campaigners had sent
   anti-Pyongyang leaflets, alongside food and USB sticks containing South
   Korean news and dramas, into the North, usually by balloons or in
   bottles on border rivers.

   The leaflets were often printed on small plastic bags, which are known
   to be coveted by North Koreans, with messages harshly critical of the
   North Korean leadership and news and information about the democratic
   South.

   North Korea reacted angrily to the practice and denounced it as an
   obstacle to better relations between the two Koreas. Some residents of
   border towns also criticized the action as stoking tension and putting
   their safety at risk.
