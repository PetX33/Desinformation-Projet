China investing "unprecedented resources" in disinformation, surveillance
tactics, new report says

   By Olivia Gazis

   China's government is investing "unprecedented resources" in a range of
   disinformation, surveillance and censorship tactics it uses in efforts
   to shape international narratives in its favor among foreign audiences
   around the world, a new report released Thursday by the State
   Department said.

   "As the [People's Republic of China] has grown more confident in its
   power, it appears to have calculated that it can more aggressively
   pursue its interests via information manipulation," the report,
   compiled by the department's Global Engagement Center, said.

   It warned that some of the methods Beijing has honed and is spending
   billions on annually are "deceptive and coercive," use false or biased
   claims, or involve technologically-enabled tracking or suppression
   techniques to stifle criticism of its policies or political leadership.

   The report, which relied on publicly available information, as well as
   information collected by the U.S. government, listed as examples the
   Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) use of automated bot networks to
   amplify Chinese diplomats' own posts (or attack those of critics), its
   use of state media employees posing as social media "influencers" to
   reach foreign audiences and its acquisition of satellite and
   telecommunications technologies to monitor and control information
   online.

   Chinese state media "routinely amplified" pro-Kremlin or anti-NATO
   propaganda in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including
   boosting Moscow's claims there were secret biological weapons
   facilities funded by the United States on Ukraine's territory,
   according to the report.

   "Russia has returned the favor by promoting PRC propaganda related to
   Taiwan and other PRC interests," the report said.

   One example included in the report noted the Beijing "heavily
   amplified" its own messaging about the military and economic responses
   it took to protest former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to
   Taiwan in August of last year, while suppressing statements that were
   critical of the Chinese government's reaction.

   It also said the Chinese government had used real-world intimidation
   tactics to discourage dissent. Citing information obtained by the U.S.
   government, it said authorities within the CCP worked with private
   companies within China to "identify and locate critics abroad who might
   have considered online anonymity a protection against PRC government
   retaliation or harassment." The report did not name the companies.

   "You can see a breathtaking ambition to have information dominance in
   certain parts of the world, crucial parts of the world," GEC
   coordinator James Rubin said in a briefing on Thursday. "That's the
   threat that affects our national security that affects the national
   security of other parties."

   The GEC assessment said certain countries were beginning to follow
   Beijing's example, noting some African governments have used Huawei
   communication systems provided by China to track the locations and
   intercept communications of political opposition members.

   It also said Beijing's successes were more limited in democratic
   countries.

   "Although backed by unprecedented resources, the PRC's propaganda and
   censorship have, to date, yielded mixed results," the report said.
   "When targeting democratic countries, Beijing has encountered major
   setbacks, often due to pushback from local media and civil society."
