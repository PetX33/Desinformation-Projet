   X Users Falsely Claim Video of 2017 Attack on Philippines Church Shows
   Hamas Attack in Gaza

   “#HamasTerrorists destroying a Baptist Church in #Gaza city and kicking
   the statue of Jesus, is this their fight to reclaim their land or is it
   Jihad against every other religion in this world, ask yourselves !!”
   False

   Blue-checked users with an active subscription to X Premium continue to
   use the social media platform to spread disinformation about the
   Israel-Hamas conflict.

   Their tactics include recycling old footage and misattributing it
   either to the Israeli armed forces or to Hamas and Palestinians,
   depending on loyalties. A viral video of a 2017 church attack in the
   Philippines is one such example.

   More than 300 people died in [30]the fight between the Philippines
   security forces and Maute militants affiliated with the Islamic State
   terrorist group, who seized the southern city of Marawi in May 2017.

   A blue-checked X user with the handle MithilaWaala shared a clip of
   Maute gunmen attacking the church in Marawi with the following false
   commentary:

   “#HamasTerrorists destroying a Baptist Church in #Gaza city and kicking
   the statue of Jesus, is this their fight to reclaim their land or is it
   Jihad against every other religion in this world, ask yourselves !!”


   Another X user [34]claimed the footage showed Israel Defense Forces
   desecrating a church in Gaza.

   Kanthan2030, a verified X user with 110,100 followers who regularly
   spreads pro-Russia disinformation, [35]quoted another post with the
   same footage, falsely claiming it showed an attack by Syrian rebels:

   “Ignorance in US/EU is shocking. Terrorists in the video below were the
   ‘moderate rebels’ armed, trained & funded by US/NATO. These jihadists
   were used to attack Syrian President Assad, who is loved by Christians
   in Syria. So, don’t use this video to justify bombing of Gaza.”

   Kanthan2030 quoted RadioGenoa, a blue-checked user with over 292,000
   followers. RadioGenoa simply wrote: “They hate us.”

   That post received 7 million views and 30,000 likes.

   While RadioGenoa never claimed the footage was from Gaza, a community
   note clarified that the footage actually showed an Islamic State
   affiliate destroying a church during the 2017 Siege of Marawi in the
   Philippines province of Lanao del Sur.

   The clip shared by MithilaWaala did not include a community note, but
   rather a message with a hyperlink from X that reads: “Stay informed.
   This media is presented out of context. Find out more.”

   militants destroying a Catholic Church in Marawi, Philippines, is
   actually from Gaza.

   user, who falsely claimed a 2017 video showing ISIS-affiliated
   militants destroying a Catholic Church in Marawi, Philippines, is
   actually from Gaza.

   However, the hyperlink outlines X’s synthetic and manipulated media
   policy, while no further context for the footage posted by MithilaWaala
   is provided.

   X says that under its policy, it can remove “media that is shared in a
   deceptive manner or with false context” which can result in “widespread
   confusion on public issues, impact public safety, or cause serious
   harm.”

   But MithilaWaala’s post was not removed, despite posting footage in a
   deceptive manner with false context.

   These attempts by premium X subscribers to pass off old footage as
   Israel-Hamas war footage fit into a broader disinformation pattern.

   that blue-checked, “verified” X users had accounted for 74 percent of
   the platform’s most viral false or unsubstantiated claims during the
   first week of the Israel-Hamas War, which started on October 7.

   Polygraph.info has documented other such examples [37]here and

   NewsGuard said that community notes “fail to debunk misinformation
   almost 70 percent of the time.”

   posts that go viral, including disinformation. That’s because
   blue-checked users are eligible for ad revenue sharing if they have 500
   followers and have generated five million impressions in the preceding
   three months.

   Separately, a European Commission [41]report found that the engagement
   of pro-Kremlin accounts spreading disinformation on X, particularly
   about Ukraine, had grown by 36 percent “after CEO Elon Musk decided to
   lift mitigation measures on Kremlin-backed accounts.”

   In September, European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova
   disinformation posts.”
