Disinformation reimagined: how AI could erode democracy in the 2024 US
elections

   Advances in generative artificial intelligence could supercharge the
   propaganda playbook, experts warn


   Wed 19 Jul 2023 16.00 CESTLast modified on Thu 20 Jul 2023 16.00 CEST

   A banal dystopia where manipulative content is so cheap to make and so
   easy to produce on a massive scale that it becomes ubiquitous: that’s
   the political future digital experts are worried about in the age of
   generative artificial intelligence (AI).

   In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, social media platforms
   were vectors for misinformation as far-right activists, foreign
   influence campaigns and fake news sites worked to spread false
   information and sharpen divisions. Four years later, the 2020 election
   was overrun with conspiracy theories and baseless claims about voter
   fraud that were amplified to millions, fueling an anti-democratic
   movement to overturn the election.

   Now, as the 2024 presidential election comes into view, experts warn
   that advances in AI have the potential to take the disinformation
   tactics of the past and breathe new life into them.

   AI-generated disinformation not only threatens to deceive audiences,
   but also erode an already embattled information ecosystem by flooding
   it with inaccuracies and deceptions, experts say.

     Degrees of trust will go down, the job of journalists and others who
     are trying to disseminate actual information will become harder

   Ben Winters of the Electronic Privacy Information Center

   “Degrees of trust will go down, the job of journalists and others who
   are trying to disseminate actual information will become harder,” said
   Ben Winters, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information
   Center, a privacy research non-profit. “It will have no positive
   effects on the information ecosystem.”

New tools for old tactics

   Artificial intelligence tools that can create photorealistic images,
   mimic voice audio and write convincingly human text have surged in use
   this year, as companies such as OpenAI have released their products on
   the mass market. The technology, which has already threatened to
   inequalities, is increasingly being employed to create political
   content.

   In past months, [113]an AI-generated image of an explosion at the
   Pentagon caused a brief dip in the stock market. AI audio parodies of
   US presidents playing video games became a viral trend. AI-generated
   images that appeared to show Donald Trump fighting off police officers
   trying to arrest him circulated widely on social media platforms. The
   Republican National Committee released an [114]entirely AI-generated ad
   that showed images of various imagined disasters that would take place
   if Biden were re-elected, while the American Association of Political
   Consultants warned that video deepfakes present a “threat to
   democracy”.

   In some ways, these images and ads are not so different from the
   manipulated images and video, misleading messages and robocalls that
   have been a feature of society for years. But disinformation campaigns
   formerly faced a range of logistic hurdles – creating individualized
   messages for social media was incredibly time consuming, as was
   Photoshopping images and editing videos.

   Now, though, generative AI has made the creation of such content
   accessible to anyone with even basic digital skills, amid [115]limited
   guardrails or effective regulation to curtail it. The potential effect,
   experts warn, is a sort of democratization and acceleration of
   propaganda right at a time when several countries enter major election
   years.

AI lowers the bar for disinformation

   The potential harms of AI on elections can read like a greatest hits of
   concerns from past decades of election interference. Social media bots
   that pretend to be real voters, manipulated videos or images, and even
   deceptive robocalls are all easier to produce and harder to detect with
   the help of AI tools.

   There are also new opportunities for foreign countries to attempt to
   influence US elections or undermine their integrity, as [116]federal
   officials have long warned Russia and China are working to do. Language
   barriers to creating deceptive content are eroding, and telltale signs
   of scammers or disinformation campaigns using repetitive phrasing or
   strange word choices are being replaced with more believable texts.

   “If you’re sitting in a troll farm in a foreign country, you no longer
   need to be fluent to produce a fluent-sounding article in the language
   of your target audience,” said Josh Goldstein, a research fellow at
   Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.
   “You can just have a language model spit out an article with the
   grammar and vocabulary of a fluent speaker.”

   AI technology may also intensify voter suppression campaigns to target
   marginalized communities. Two far-right activists [117]admitted last
   year to making more than 67,000 robocalls targeting Black voters in the
   midwest with election misinformation, and experts such as Winters note
   that AI could hypothetically be used to replicate such a campaign on a
   greater scale with more personalized information. Audio that mimics
   elected leaders or trusted personalities could tell select groups of
   voters misleading information about polls and voting, or cause general
   confusion.

   Generating letter-writing campaigns or fake engagement could also
   create a sort of false constituency, making it unclear how voters are
   actually responding to issues. As part of [118]a research experiment
   published earlier this year, Cornell University professors Sarah Kreps
   and Doug Kriner sent tens of thousands of emails to more than 7,000
   state legislators across the country. The emails purported to be from
   concerned voters, but were split between AI-generated letters and ones
   written by a human. The responses were virtually the same, with
   human-written emails receiving only a 2% higher rate of reply than the
   AI-generated ones.

Campaigns test the waters

   Campaigns have already begun dabbling in using AI-generated content for
   political purposes. After Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, announced
   his candidacy during a Twitter live stream in May, Donald Trump mocked
   his opponent with a parody video of the announcement that featured the
   AI-generated voices of DeSantis, Elon Musk and Adolf Hitler. Last
   month, the DeSantis campaign [123]shared AI-generated images of Trump
   embracing and kissing Anthony Fauci.

     AI-generated images and videos can be created much more quickly than
     factcheckers can review and debunk them

   Josh Goldstein of Georgetown University

   During the 2016 and 2020 elections, Trump’s campaign leaned heavily on
   memes and videos made by his supporters – including [124]deceptively
   edited videos that made it seem like Biden was slurring his words or
   saying that he shouldn’t be president. The AI version of that strategy
   is creeping in, election observers warn, with Trump sharing a deepfake
   video in May of the CNN host Anderson Cooper [125]telling viewers that
   they had just watched “Trump ripping us a new asshole here on CNN’s
   live presidential town hall”.

   With about 16 months to go until the presidential election and
   widespread generative AI use still in its early days, it’s an open
   question what role artificial intelligence will play in the vote. The
   creation of misleading AI-generated content alone doesn’t mean that it
   will have an effect on an election, researchers say, and measuring the
   impact of disinformation campaigns is a notoriously difficult task.
   It’s one thing to monitor the engagement of fake materials but another
   to gauge the secondary effects of polluting the information ecosystem
   to the point where people generally distrust any information they
   consume online.

   But there are concerning signs. Just as the use of generative AI is
   increasing, many of the social media platforms that bad actors rely on
   to spread disinformation [126]have begun rolling back some of their
   content moderation measures – YouTube reversed its election integrity
   policy, Instagram allowed the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F
   Kennedy Jr back on its platform and Twitter’s head of content
   moderation left the company in June amid a general fall in standards
   under Elon Musk.

   It remains to be seen how effective media literacy and traditional
   means of factchecking can be in pushing back against a deluge of
   misleading text and images, researchers say, as the potential scale of
   generated content represents a new challenge.

   “AI-generated images and videos can be created much more quickly than
   factcheckers can review and debunk them,” Goldstein said, adding that
   hype over AI can also corrode trust by making the public believe
   anything could be artificially generated.

   Some generative AI services, including ChatGPT, do have policies and
   safeguards against generating misinformation and in certain cases are
   able to block the service from being used for that purpose. But it’s
   still unclear how effective those are, and several open-source models
   lack such policies and features.

   “There’s not really going to be sufficient control of dissemination,”
   Winters said. “There’s no shortage of robocallers, robo emailers or
   texters, and mass email platforms. There’s nothing limiting the use of
   those.”
