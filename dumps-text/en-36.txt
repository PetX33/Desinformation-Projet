85% of people worry about online disinformation, global survey finds

   UN announces plan to tackle phenomenon as survey finds people worry
   particularly about impact on elections

   More than 85% of people are worried about the impact of online
   disinformation and 87% believe it has already harmed their country’s
   politics, according to a global survey, as the United Nations announced
   a plan to tackle the phenomenon.

   Audrey Azoulay, director general of the UN’s culture body, Unesco, told
   reporters on Monday that false information and hate speech online –
   accelerated and amplified by social media platforms – posed “major
   risks to social cohesion, peace and stability”.

   Regulation was urgently needed “to protect access to information …
   while at the same time protecting freedom of expression and human
   rights”, Azoulay said as she presented a “governance blueprint” for
   governments, regulators and platforms.

   A Unesco-commissioned survey in 16 countries due to hold national
   elections next year – with a total of 2.5 billion voters – showed how
   pressing the need for effective regulation had become, the organisation
   said.

   The survey by pollster Ipsos of 8,000 people in countries including
   Austria, Croatia, the US, Algeria, Mexico, Ghana and India, found that
   56% of internet users got their news mainly from social media, far more
   than from TV (44%) or media sites (29%).

   Social media was the main source of news in almost every country,
   despite trust in the information it provided being significantly lower
   than in traditional media: 50% against 66% for television, 63% for
   radio and 57% for media websites and apps.

   Across all 16 countries, 68% of respondents said social media was where
   fake news was most widespread, ahead of messaging apps (38%), a belief
   “overwhelmingly prevalent in all countries, age groups, social
   backgrounds and political preferences”.

   Disinformation was overwhelmingly seen as a concrete threat, with 85%
   saying they worried about its influence. Eighty-seven per cent said
   disinformation had already had a major impact on national political
   life and would play a part in 2024’s elections.

   Hate speech was also seen as widespread: 67% of respondents said they
   had seen it online (and 74% of under-35s). Large majorities (88%) said
   governments and regulators must address both issues, and 90% also
   wanted platforms to take action.

   Vigilance was seen as particularly important during election campaigns.
   Of those polled, 89% demanded government and regulatory intervention
   and 91% expected social media platforms to be even more alert when
   democracy was directly in play.

   “People are very concerned about disinformation, across every country
   and social category – age, education, rural or urban,” said Mathieu
   Gallard of Ipsos. “They are especially worried during elections – and
   they want all actors to fight it.”

   Unesco said its plan, based on seven key principles, had emerged from a
   consultation process that it described as “unprecedented” in the UN
   system, drawing on more than 10,000 contributions from 134 countries
   over an 18-month period.

   Guilherme Canela de Souza Godoi, Unesco’s chief of section for freedom
   of expression, said more than 50 countries were already regulating
   social media, but often not in accordance with international free
   speech and human rights norms.

   The guidelines represented “a strong blueprint based on a human rights
   approach, designed to inform and inspire governments and regulators”,
   he said, adding that several African and Latin American countries had
   already expressed interest.

   At least one major platform had told the 194-member UN body it would
   prefer a consistent global governance framework over a proliferation of
   national and regional systems, Unesco said. It plans to organise a
   World Conference of Regulators in 2024.

   It said the seven key principles must be respected to ensure that the
   impact on human rights becomes “the compass for all decision-making at
   every stage and by every stakeholder”.

   Independent and well-resourced public regulators must be established
   everywhere, Unesco said, and should work closely together as part of a
   wider network to prevent digital organisations from taking advantage of
   national regulatory differences.

   Platforms must moderate content effectively and at scale, in all
   regions and in all languages, and be “accountable and transparent with
   regard to algorithms that are too often geared towards maximising
   engagement at the cost of reliable information”.

   Regulators and platforms must also take stronger measures – including
   risk assessments, content flagging and greater transparency around
   political advertising – during elections and crises such as armed
   conflicts and disasters, Unesco said.
