‘A success for Kremlin propaganda’: how pro-Putin views permeate Italian
media

   With pro-Russia commentators regularly appearing on TV, Italians are
   less likely to back Ukraine than people in most other EU states

   Whenever Nello Scavo returns from Ukraine, he is overcome with
   frustration. As a war correspondent for the Italian national newspaper
   Avvenire, he knows the first question people will ask him is: “Is it
   really as bad as they say?”

   “Sometimes I think that only if I come back badly injured will people
   start taking me seriously,” he told the Guardian. “It’s as if they
   don’t believe that Russia is massacring civilians. The problem is that
   Vladimir Putin has always enjoyed wide sympathy in Italian politics and
   public opinion, with the Kremlin always enjoying effective propaganda
   here.”

   Although Italy’s far-right government is one of Ukraine’s staunchest
   European supporters, Russian propaganda and disinformation permeates
   Italian media – something researchers attribute to politics and
   historical anti-Atlanticism – with openly pro-Russian guests invited on
   the country’s most popular talkshows. A survey released by Ipsos in
   April revealed that almost 50% of Italians prefer not to take sides in
   the conflict.

   Matteo Pugliese, an Italian security and terrorism researcher at the
   University of Barcelona has tracked the procession of Russian
   government officials, ideologues and media personalities hosted by
   Italian TV networks since the Russian invasion. They include the
   Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his spokesperson, Maria
   Zakharova; the ultranationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin; Olga
   Belova, a journalist at Russia 24, an outlet that denied the Bucha
   massacre; and Yulia Vityazeva, a journalist at NewsFront – based in
   Russia-occupied Crimea and operated by the FSB – who, in a Telegram
   post, wished a bomb would strike the Eurovision song contest in Turin
   after Ukraine’s victory.

   “Compared to other western European countries, Italy gave
   disproportionate exposure to Russian propaganda, in my opinion simply
   because TV producers wanted to increase their share of certain shows
   with heated debates,” Pugliese said.

   Pugliese noted the most Russian propagandists, 12, were hosted by
   Rete4, a channel from Mediaset, owned by Silvio Berlusconi, an old
   friend of Putin who, a few months before he died, claimed that the
   Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, “provoked” Russia’s invasion.
   Berlusconi, who served as prime minister three times, nurtured close
   relations with the Russian president, praising his leadership and
   helping to forge energy deals that some blame for Italy’s current
   dependence on Russian gas.

   “In Italy, rightwing parties especially have maintained good relations
   with Putin,” Scavo said. “Not only Berlusconi, but even current deputy
   PM Matteo Salvini, who used to wear a T-shirt featuring Putin’s face.”

   Italy’s parliamentary committee for security, Copasir, last year
   launched an investigation amid widespread concern about Kremlin-linked
   Russian commentators appearing on Italian news channels, as several
   Ukrainian journalists refused to accept invitations to Italian TV
   shows.

   In some cases the guests on Italian TV are not Russian propagandists,
   but Italian commentators who seem to view the war as the result of
   western provocation. One regularly invited to La7 and Rai, is
   Alessandro Orsini, professor of the sociology of terrorism and
   political violence at Luiss university in Rome. Orsini has publicly
   said that Zelenskiy is as much a “war criminal” as Putin and has become
   so popular that his discussions in Italian theatres sell out. Orsini,
   who calls himself a pacifist, believes the only way to save Ukraine is
   to recognise Putin’s supposed victory. His ideas are widespread in the
   Italian pacifist movement, with several intellectuals pushing for peace
   at the cost of Ukraine’s surrender. When accused of being pro-Russian,
   Orsini said he “didn’t even have one Russian friend”.

   “It’s not pacifism to suggest surrender as a solution,” said Arianna
   Ciccone, founder of Valigia Blu, an Italian independent factchecking
   website, and co-founder of the International Journalism Festival.

   “These people have always been historically anti-Nato. They
   hypocritically hide their anti-Americanism behind a ‘mask’ of pacifism.
   In some cases this results in genuine anti-Ukrainian sentiment. We’ve
   often had well-known journalists and philosophers on TV expressing
   doubts about Bucha and Mariupol. Not even with the mountain of evidence
   have they had the courage to admit the truth. How can they be
   pacifists?”

   Last year, an independent study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue
   (ISD) revealed Italy had the most shared posts on social media casting
   doubt about Russian war crimes perpetrated in Bucha.

   Italian TV presenters defend their decision to host alleged Russian
   propagandists or commentators with “different views” on the war as part
   of a duty to give voice to both sides of the conflict. “In doing so,
   however, they do not seem to care that those defending the Russian
   invasion often spread disinformation and thus help to destabilise
   viewers with baseless claims,” Ciccone added.

   One glaring example is Moscow’s claim – dismissed by the UN, and used
   as a justification for its full-scale invasion in 2022 – that Ukrainian
   military action in the Donbas conflict amounted to genocide. Dozens of
   Italians joined Russian proxies in Donbas in the years after 2014 to
   fight against Kyiv.

   The majority of them are rightwing extremists attracted by Russian
   ultranationalism, but their ranks also count among them men belonging
   to the extreme left. In part this was a legacy of the postwar strength
   of the Italian Communist party, which peaked at 34.4% share of the vote
   in 1976 and backed what was seen as the resistance of communist
   countries against American imperialism. This vision, in part, still
   animates supporters of the Italian extreme left who see Russia as a
   bulwark against the US, and also believe Putin’s claims about
   “Ukrainian Nazis”. To mark Victory Day in 2022, a holiday that
   commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, the Communist party
   of Zagarolo, Rome, released a series of posters featuring the letter Z
   used by the Russian government as a pro-war motif. The organisers of
   the event dismissed critics, saying it “was not a provocation”.

   According to a Pew Research Center survey released in July, Italy is
   among the countries in the EU where people have the lowest confidence
   in Zelenskiy. According to the European Council on Foreign Relations,
   Italians were the most sympathetic to Russia of member states polled,
   with 27% blaming Ukraine and the US for the war.

   “The result of all this is a great confusion in Italian public opinion,
   which struggles over who to blame for the war, blaming equally Russia
   and Ukraine,” said Pugliese. “This is certainly a success for Kremlin
   propaganda.”
