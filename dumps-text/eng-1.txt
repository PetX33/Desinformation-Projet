   WARSAW, Poland -- Poland's government warned citizens Thursday to
   beware of a disinformation campaign after some people got fake messages
   saying that the ruling party was offering free funerals for pensioners.

   The country is facing a crucial national [7]election on Sunday, and the
   fake messages and the warnings come as cyber experts have warned of the
   risks of disinformation.

   The fake text message urged recipients to vote for Poland's ruling Law
   and Justice party, adding: ’“We will provide funerals for pensioners
   for free.” The party denied making such a campaign promise, and warned
   citizens to disregard the messages.

   The intention of the messages wasn't clear. The government already
   offers partial compensation for funeral expenses, but offering to pay
   fully has not been an issue in the election campaign.

   Lukasz Olejnik, a cybersecurity expert and co-author of a recent book,
   “Philosophy of Cybersecurity,” said it wasn't clear if the messages
   amounted to disinformation, or if they were someone's idea of a bad
   joke or trolling.

   But the messages would more likely hurt the ruling party because the
   offer of free funeral service ”can be read as a suggestion that you
   should die soon," Olejnik said in an email to The Associated Press.

   “No sane political party would issue such a message to their
   electorate. People prefer to focus on remaining alive.”

   In any case, the messages could potentially skew the election.

   “The potential for disruption is there if someone does not have the
   ability or willingness to read between the lines, or does not have the
   necessary sense of humor," Olejnik said.

   Stanislaw Zaryn, a top security official, alleged that the fake
   messages were “part of Russia’s operation against the elections in
   Poland.”
