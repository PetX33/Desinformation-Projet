Jordan’s war on facts continues with attacks on disinfo experts

   A report from the Jim Jordan-led House Judiciary Committee’s
   “weaponization” panel levels baseless accusations of “censorship” and
   “unconstitutional behavior.”
   June 29, 2023, 9:58 AM UTC

   By [64]Ja'han Jones

   A [65]sketchy new report released Tuesday by the House Judiciary
   Committee’s [66]Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal
   Government tries to paint an ominous picture of the [67]Cybersecurity
   and Infrastructure Security Agency.

   Some quick background: In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security
   officially [68]de[69]signated[70] election i[71]nfrastructure as
   falling [72]within CISA’s purview. The agency has since been key in
   garnering insight and offering guidance to private and public entities
   on how to stop the spread of misinformation and disinformation online.

   The issue of online disinformation [73]came to a head during the 2016
   presidential election, and it remains a problem in the lead-up to the
   2024 elections. Of course, many Republicans these days [74]rely on
   propaganda rooted [75]in falsehoods to advance their political goals,
   so they have portrayed federal agencies’ war against disinformation as
   a war on conservatives.

   That’s how we get to [76]Tuesday’s interim staff report, which accuses
   CISA of “unconstitutional behavior” and refers to the agency as “the
   nerve center of the federal government’s domestic surveillance and
   censorship operations on social media.”

   That word — “censorship” — appears dozens of times in the 36-page
   report, which accuses CISA of “censorship by proxy.” In other words,
   the committee is claiming that the agency is engaged in censorship by
   merely sharing information (such as tips received from local election
   officials) with social media companies, because the companies could
   feel pressured to adopt CISA’s suggestions. But the “[77]Twitter Files”
   conspiracy theory (also pushed by the “weaponization” committee)
   ironically disproved this by showing that companies can receive
   information from the government [78]and still independently reach
   conclusions about content moderation.

   However, the committee’s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, isn’t letting
   the facts drown out some useful propaganda. He and his conservative
   allies have been building up to this report for several months now.
   ProPublica reported in March that Jordan had begun issuing
   “[79]sweeping information requests” to universities and a think tank,
   in which he accused the institutions of participating in the Biden
   administration’s “censorship regime.”

   On June 6, The Washington Post [80]reported on Kate Starbird, the
   co-founder of an [81]anti-disinformation think tank at the University
   of Washington who has faced [82]online [83]harassment over[84] her
   work. Some of the documents Jordan obtained relating to Starbird appear
   to form the basis of the committee report’s dubious “censorship”
   claims.

   For example, the report notes that Starbird formerly served as chair of
   the now-defunct Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Misinformation
   & Disinformation subcommittee, which the Department of Homeland
   Security established for disinformation experts to provide insight to
   CISA. The report cites communications from Starbird in which she
   expressed concern about public attention.

   And reading the report, one might conclude Starbird thought the
   advisory board had something to hide. But at the time, right-wing
   conspiracy theorists were spreading lies about the disinformation work
   within the DHS — [85]including [86]the[87] creation of a now-defunct
   Disinformation Governance Board. With that as context, Starbird’s words
   read as though she’s simply concerned about the public perception of
   the advisory board’s work — perhaps even concerned that its intentions
   would be misstated by bad actors. But not concerned about the value of
   the work itself.

   On Tuesday, [88]Starbird told CBS News that the report from Jordan’s
   committee “grossly misrepresented” her work and the advisory board’s:

     This report disregards clarifying information within the broader
     record of our subcommittee’s communications and final
     recommendations — as well as my voluntary testimony to this
     Committee — to push a misleading narrative of censorship. Our
     subcommittee played no role in censoring any speech, nor did we
     advocate for the social media platforms to take any action to limit
     the spread of speech.

   The facts are on Starbird’s side. There’s still no evidence of a
   government conspiracy to suppress right-wing views. Unfortunately, the
   GOP’s search for victimhood is not a fact-driven enterprise.
